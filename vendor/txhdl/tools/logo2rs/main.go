// index a pixel.

//	logo2rs -in txhdl-icon.png -w 144 -h 144 > lib/logo/logo.rs
//
// The logo is drawn one logo pixel to one screen pixel, 144 square in
// a corner of the 640 by 480 scanout, so that the wordmark under the
// hat can be read (issue 1213). At 36 square, four screen pixels to a
// logo pixel, it could not. The 512 by 512 source is averaged down in
// boxes, which is a proper downscale rather than a pick of one pixel
// in each box.
//
// A pixel is an index into a palette of sixteen 24-bit colours, the
// scanout's 0x00RRGGBB, two pixels to a byte: 144 square is 10 KB that
// way where a word a pixel was 41 KB. Index 0 is not a colour: it is
// what the background of the logo became, and a caller skips it, so
// the logo sits on whatever is already drawn. The fifteen colours are
// the logo's own, found by k-means from a fixed start, so the output is
// the same every run.
//
// This is run by hand and its output is committed, which is the same
// arrangement the layout numbers under docs/ have: a Bazel action
// cannot reach the shared drive the logo lives on, and the logo
// changes about as often as the die does.
//
// The background of the source is a dark gradient that reads as noise
// in a corner, so a box as dark as -dark or darker is transparent.
// That leaves the hat and the lettering, which is what a logo in a
// corner is for.
//
// The standard library alone: image/png is in it.
