//! A VHDL testbench from a trace. The Rust simulation wrote an FST; the
//! lowering wrote the entity and a ports file. This replays the trace's
//! inputs into the entity and asserts, at every tick, that the entity's
//! registers and outputs are what the trace holds.
//!
//! Time: one tick is 1 ns and the clock rises at even ticks. An input
//! the trace holds at tick 2k was set before that edge, so it is applied
//! at 2k-1. A register the trace holds at tick 2k took its value at that
//! edge, so it is checked at 2k+1. A wire the Rust process drove at
//! tick 2k was computed from the registers as they stood before that
//! edge, so it is checked at 2k-1, where the entity's continuous
//! assignment shows the same value; and from the inputs of that edge,
//! so the inputs are applied a tenth of a tick before 2k-1, every wire
//! settles however deep, and the checks come just before 2k-1, ahead
//! of the falling edge there, which is where the Verilog testbench
//! checks too; a falling-edge register is therefore checked against
//! the trace at 2k-1, the edge before. A channel's inputs, the head
//! of the buffer on the receiving side and the room on the sending
//! side, are registered state of the channel: the trace at 2k holds
//! them as that edge left them, which is what the entity sees during
//! the cycle after it, so
//! they are applied at 2k+1. A sender's data is checked only at ticks
//! where the trace has its valid high, since under a low valid the
//! trace holds the last offer and the entity computes the wire anyway.
//!
//! Held and pulsed are the two kinds of signal here, and they are
//! checked differently. A register and a wire are held: each keeps its
//! value until the next edge, so reading one late gives the same value
//! later and the only question is which edge to count from, which is
//! what the per-port period above settles. A channel's `ready` and
//! `valid` are not held. The runtime asserts one while the `recv` or
//! `send` runs, so the trace has it high at that port's own clock edge
//! and low at every tick between, while the entity computes the same
//! wire combinationally and may legitimately show something else in
//! between. There is no offset that turns a pulse into a held signal,
//! so a handshake is compared only at a tick which is an edge of its
//! own clock, and the frame says nothing about it elsewhere.
//!
//! That is the trace having no opinion between edges rather than the
//! check being dropped where it was inconvenient, and the difference
//! is worth stating because they look the same from outside. Only the
//! value at an edge is read by anything synchronous: the handshake
//! decides whether a transfer happened at that edge, and no register
//! on either side samples it in between. So the entity's wire being
//! high at a tick where the trace holds low is not two implementations
//! disagreeing, it is a tick at which nothing asked. The boundary that
//! follows is real and worth knowing: this testbench cannot catch an
//! entity whose handshake is wrong strictly between its own edges.
//! Nothing reads it there, and nothing here looks. A
//! sender's data follows its valid, for the same reason and at the
//! same ticks. Under the default clock every tick the testbench visits
//! is an edge, which is why this was invisible until a unit had a
//! channel on a slower clock (issue 384).
//!
//! Form: in VHDL, one procedure holds a tick; a cycle's inputs and
//! expected values are one string of bits, a frame, kept as hex, and
//! the replay is a loop over constant arrays of frames, each array a
//! package of its own of a few hundred frames. nvc's heap for one
//! design unit is finite, and a statement per check, or a call per
//! cycle with an argument per signal, is more than it holds for a run
//! of a few hundred cycles; a literal is data, but a unit of half a
//! megabyte of them is over the limit too, so they are spread.
//!
//! Usage: fst2tb FILE.fst FILE.vhd.ports ENTITY UNIT
//!          [--verilog VECTORS PATH] > tb
//! where UNIT is the name the Rust testbench gave the unit in the trace;
//! `--verilog` writes the same testbench in Verilog, for Verilator, with
//! its frames in the file VECTORS, which the testbench opens as PATH.
