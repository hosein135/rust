"""A unit's checks proved, searched or covered with SymbiYosys.

`formal_test` runs SymbiYosys on the Verilog a `waveform()` wrote, in
one of its three modes, and passes when the run ends the way it is
expected to: a proof that holds, or a broken unit that fails.
`formal_run` is the same run as a build step, for a document that
includes the run's log and its trace. Both run formal.sh, which says
how the tools are found and what the modes mean (issue 581).
