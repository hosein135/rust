# Every component has a datasheet. A component is a unit under
# `#[lower]` in the crates this test is given, or a type a family macro
# writes (`station!`). A unit in a module declared under `#[cfg(test)]`
# is a fixture of the crate's tests and is not one. A datasheet
# says what it covers on a line `% covers: A, B, C` in
# `docs/datasheets/`. The test lists each component nobody covers, and
# each datasheet the document does not include, and fails if there is
# either.
#
# A component is named by its path as well as its type: its crate, from
# the directory it is in, and its module, from its file, so
# `lib/parts/src/hdmi.rs`'s `Raster` is `txhdl_parts::hdmi::Raster`. A
# sheet may cover a component by either name, unless two components
# share the type's name: then only the path says which, and a sheet
# that names the type alone covers neither (issue 1055).
