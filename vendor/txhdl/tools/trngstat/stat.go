// the serial line is busy with the last. A `rawrun` is the other kind:
// words whose samples follow on from each other, the oldest in bit 31
// of the first, so a lag longer than a word can be measured. Two kinds
// of run are printed: `rawrun`, joined from overlapping windows a loop
// read, and `rawcap`, the peripheral's own capture. They are two runs
// and not one, since the second does not follow on from the first, so
// each has a field of its own and is measured on its own (issue 835).
