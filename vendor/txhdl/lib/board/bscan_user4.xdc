# The cable's clock out of the USER4 scan chain (issue 154). OpenOCD's
# adapter runs it at 1 MHz (tools/openocd/ax7a200.cfg); 30 MHz bounds
# it. It is a clock of its own, asynchronous to every other. Its
# channels cross to the board's clock through ChanCdc; the reset, made
# on the board's clock (cpu/vreteno/board/vreteno_board.v), reaches its
# registers too (issue 885). The instance is named, because Vivado's
# debug hub has a BSCANE2 of its own on another chain.
