//! `Wire<T>` is a `let` kept as a field: the process drives it with
//! `set`, may read it back in the same step, and it shows in the trace
//! under the unit's name like a register, while in the netlist it is
//! the wire the `let` would have been. The unit is a divider by three
//! that keeps its two internal decisions in wires; the testbench never
//! sees them through a port, and the waveform shows them anyway. The
//! netlist is checked against the trace under nvc and Verilator, wires
//! included.
