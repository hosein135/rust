//! An AXI4 arbiter: two hosts, one memory, and the answers finding
//! their way home.
//!
//! The arbiter is the router's mirror. The router takes one host and
//! several peripherals and decides on the address; the arbiter takes
//! several hosts and one peripheral and decides whose turn it is. Put
//! the two together and a design has a bus rather than a wire.
//!
//! The hard part is not the deciding. It is that an answer has to
//! reach the host that asked, and the peripheral does not know there
//! are two. AXI4 carries an identifier from each address phase back
//! on its answer, so the arbiter writes the host's port number above
//! the host's own identifier on the way out and takes it off again on
//! the way back. That is why the two sides have different identifier
//! widths here: two bits on each host, five on the peripheral side.
//!
//! The other hard part is the write data channel, which carries no
//! identifier at all. A beat belongs to the oldest address phase that
//! has not finished, so the arbiter holds that channel for the burst
//! it granted until the last beat. Both hosts below write four beats
//! at the same time, and the memory sees two whole bursts rather than
//! a mixture.
//!
//! Neither client mentions the arbiter, a port number or an
//! identifier. They are the clients of the peer to peer example,
//! unchanged, and the arbiter is put between them by wiring alone.
//!
//! The arbiter is lowered here, and the build simulates its netlist
//! against this run under nvc and under Verilator.
