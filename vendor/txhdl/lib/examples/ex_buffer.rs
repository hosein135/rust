//! The channel as hardware, checked against the channel as the runtime

//! from a pattern of offers and takes, does the same offer and take on
//! a runtime channel, and asserts after every cycle that the buffer's
//! `ready`, `valid` and head are the channel's. So `Buffer` is the
//! runtime's elastic buffer of two, bit for bit, and its netlist is
//! checked against this trace under nvc and Verilator, which closes
//! the loop: a channel between two lowered units on a board behaves as
//! the channel between the two units in the run did.
