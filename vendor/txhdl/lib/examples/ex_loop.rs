//! An array of ports and a loop over it, in a lowered body (issue 500).
//!
//! `Merge<N>` takes `N` channels and forwards one word a cycle, from the
//! lowest input that has one. Its inputs are one port, `ins: [Rx<U<8>>;
//! N]`, and it goes over them with `for i in 0..N`, carrying what it has
//! found so far from one input to the next in two `let mut`s. `N` is a
//! const parameter the macro cannot see, so the loop is unrolled when
//! `lowered` runs: the netlist of `Merge<3>` has the ports `ins_0` to
//! `ins_2`, and one of `Merge<5>` five. Until then a unit of a count was
//! text a macro wrote once per count, as `station!` still does and
//! `router!` did until the router became one unit.
//!
//! The run offers words on three inputs at once, in bursts, and asserts
//! that they come out lowest input first and none is lost; the netlist
//! is checked against the run under nvc and Verilator.
