//! Two clocks in one netlist, checked against one run.
//!
//! A unit's process waits on one clock, so a design of two clocks is a
//! unit of units: one counter on the default clock, one on a clock
//! three times slower, and a parent that holds both and has no wait and
//! no register of its own; its ports name the slow clock where the slow
//! counter's do.
//! Nothing crosses between them here. That is deliberate: what this
//! example is for is the checking rather than the crossing, and a
//! crossing would put the interesting part inside a `ChanCdc` rather
//! than at the ports where a testbench can see it.
//!
//! Until issue 131 the build could not check such a unit at all. The
//! generated testbench advanced in cycles of the first clock and
//! compared every output one of those cycles after driving it, so a
//! port on the slower clock was read before its own edge had produced
//! anything, and the two disagreed for part of every period. A port
//! carries its clock now, from the type where it is written to the
//! ports file the generator reads, and each port is checked against
//! its own clock's edge.
