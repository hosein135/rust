//! Verilator makes a C++ model of the Verilog and `verilog_unit()`
//! makes a unit of that, `stage_verilog::Stage`, and `vhdl_unit()`
//! makes one of the VHDL, `stage_vhdl::Stage`, with nvc running as a
//! child process behind it. Here the three sit in three pipelines,
//! fed the same offers, and the three sinks must take the same words
//! at the same ticks: the lowering checked live, side by side, in
//! both languages, rather than by replaying a trace. A module written
//! by hand goes in the same way.
