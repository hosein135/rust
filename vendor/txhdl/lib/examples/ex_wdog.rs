//! The watchdog: a program that keeps saying it is still there, and
//! then stops.
//!
//! A host client on an AXI4 link reaches the watchdog through the
//! AXI-Lite bridge and does what a program does with one. It sets a
//! timeout, turns the watchdog on, and refreshes it with the key; the
//! count reloads each time and the reset line stays low.
//!
//! Then it stops refreshing, and the count runs out. The warning comes
//! first, because warning is on: the interrupt rises and the count
//! reloads, which gives a program that is merely slow one more timeout
//! to notice. Nothing refreshes it, so the second timeout asks for the
//! reset.
//!
//! Last it shows the two ways a refresh can be a failure rather than a
//! refresh. A wrong key is one: a program writing whatever it finds
//! over whatever it reaches must not be able to refresh a watchdog by
//! accident. A refresh while the window is shut is the other: a
//! program looping tightly on its own refresh is as stuck as one that
//! has stopped, and a plain countdown cannot tell them apart.
//!
//! The block is lowered, and the build simulates its netlist against
//! this run under nvc and Verilator.
