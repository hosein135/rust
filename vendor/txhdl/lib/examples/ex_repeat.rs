//! A counted loop whose bound is a register's value.
//!
//! `ex_serial` counted a loop of eight turns. A loop whose length is
//! only known when it is entered, a frame's byte count say, is a
//! `for` bounded by a register, `0..self.times.get().raw() as usize`.
//! The lowering compares the counter with the register as it stands, so
//! the register must hold still while the loop runs, which a register
//! the sequence itself sets before the loop does; and the counter is
//! as wide as the register, which the netlist reads off the unit's
//! fields when `lowered` runs.
//!
//! The repeater takes a word and a count on one channel and sends the
//! word that many times, one a cycle. A count of zero sends nothing:
//! the loop is entered only when its range holds a value, in the
//! netlist as in the run (issue 886). The run is checked against the
//! netlist under nvc and Verilator.
