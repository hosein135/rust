//! An SPI master on AXI-Lite, talking to a model of a flash chip.
//!
//! A host client on an AXI4 link reaches the master through the
//! AXI-Lite bridge and does what a bootloader would do before anything
//! else: it asks the chip who it is, and then reads four bytes from an
//! address.
//!
//! Both are the same shape. Hold the chip select, write a byte, wait
//! for the transfer to finish, read the byte that came back the other
//! way, repeat, release the select. SPI has no direction: the eight
//! clocks that send a byte are the eight that receive one, so the
//! answer to a command byte arrives while the next byte is being sent,
//! and a driver counts bytes rather than waiting for a reply.
//!
//! The identify command is `0x9f` and three bytes come back. The fast
//! read is `0x0b`, three bytes of address and one thrown away, and
//! then as many as are clocked. The chip on the other side is
//! `FlashDevice`, a model, stepped between cycles from the loop.
//!
//! The master is lowered, and the build simulates its netlist against
//! this run under nvc and Verilator.
