//!
//! The map is LiteEth's, so that `eth_litex_liteeth.c` ports rather
//! than being redesigned. This run does what that driver does, in the
//! order it does it, and checks the answers: poll `tx_ready`, set the
//! slot and length, write `tx_start`; and on the other side notice
//! `rx_ev_pending`, read the slot and length, and acknowledge by
//! writing the bit back.
//!
//! The acknowledgement is the part worth a test of its own.
//! `rx_ev_pending` is write-one-to-clear, so a write of zero must do
//! nothing. Hardware that cleared on any write would let a driver
//! acknowledge an interrupt it never looked at, and the frame would
//! be dropped rather than read. Nothing about the register's value
//! says which behaviour it has; only a run that writes zero and
//! checks the bit is still set does.
