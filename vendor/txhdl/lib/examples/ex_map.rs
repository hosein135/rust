//! An address map as a trait constant (issue 593).
//!
//! A unit over `N` peripherals wants `N` address ranges, and stable
//! Rust has no array const parameter to carry them. So the map is a
//! type: `Three` below implements `AddrMap<3>` with its three ranges as
//! an associated constant, and `Decode<3, Three>` is the decoder over
//! them. The unit reads `M::RANGES[i]` in a loop over `0..N`; the
//! lowering unrolls the loop when `lowered` runs and works each base
//! and mask out as a number of the netlist, as it does a const
//! parameter, so the netlist decodes the ranges the map states. The
//! array's length is checked against `N` where the map is written: a
//! map of two ranges given to a decoder of three does not compile.
//!
//! The decoder takes an address a cycle and says, one bit per range,
//! which range holds it, and whether none does. The run walks a few
//! addresses in and out of the ranges and asserts what it sees; the
//! netlist is checked against the run under nvc and Verilator.
