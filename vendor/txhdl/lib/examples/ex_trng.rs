//! An entropy source behind AXI-Lite: ring oscillators sampled, the
//! samples folded and debiased, the words buffered, and a health test
//! watching the stream.
//!
//! A host client on an AXI4 link reaches the peripheral through the
//! AXI-Lite bridge and does what a driver would: it turns the source
//! on, waits for `status` to say a word is ready, and takes eight
//! words, which it prints. It then reads `raw`, the last thirty-two
//! samples before the extractor, which is what a measurement on a
//! board reads in a loop. Last it stops the source and drains what
//! the buffer holds, which shows the count in `status` going down.
//! Then it starts the source again and takes a capture: 2048 samples
//! in a row, read back a word at a time, which the run checks are a
//! stretch of the samples the model gave with none missing (#817).
//!
//! The rings are a Verilog module the netlist instantiates and does
//! not write, and in this run they are a model with the shape of the
//! samples and none of their physics: nothing printed here is
//! evidence of randomness, only of the machinery. The peripheral is
//! lowered, and the build simulates its netlist against this run
//! under nvc and Verilator with the samples as the run recorded them.
