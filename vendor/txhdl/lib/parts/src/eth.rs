//! Ethernet: a MAC in two halves and an AXI-Lite peripheral in front
//! of them.
//!
//! [`EthTx`] and [`EthRx`] speak GMII, a byte per cycle with a valid
//! line. A board wrapper makes GMII of an RGMII PHY such as the
//! JL2121 on the AX7A200B, whose nibbles come on both clock edges.
//! Each half is a unit of one clock, so that on a board each can run
//! on the clock its side of the PHY keeps: the transmit clock the FPGA
//! makes, and the receive clock the PHY recovers from the line.
//!
//! Both halves store a whole frame before they act on it. The
//! transmitter takes a frame's bytes from a channel at whatever pace
//! they come and sends the frame only when its last byte is in, since
//! a frame on the wire cannot pause. The receiver takes a frame off
//! the wire as it comes, checks its frame check sequence, and only
//! then offers its bytes on a channel, since the wire cannot be held
//! off. So the channels between the MAC and [`EthLite`] may be slow,
//! and on a board they are where the clock domains are crossed.
//!
//! The frame a client sends is the destination address, the source
//! address, the type or length and the payload. The transmitter adds
//! the preamble, the start of frame delimiter, the padding up to sixty
//! bytes and the four bytes of the frame check sequence, a CRC-32; the
//! receiver strips the preamble and the check sequence and drops a
//! frame whose check fails.
