//! An SPI master on AXI-Lite, and a model of a flash chip to check it
//! against.
//!
//! Three registers. A program sets the divider, the mode and the chip
//! select in the first, writes a byte to the second to start a
//! transfer, and reads the second again to get the byte that came back
//! the other way, because SPI sends and receives in the same eight
//! clocks. The third says whether a transfer is running and whether
//! one has finished.
//!
//! The three registers and their fields are declared once with
//! `regmap!` below (issue 675): `ctrl` is the divider in bits 0 to 7,
//! then `cpol` in bit 8, `cpha` in bit 9, the chip select in bit 10 and
//! the interrupt enable in bit 11; `data` is the byte; `state` is
//! running in bit 0 and finished in bit 1, which a written one clears.
//! A half of a bit takes `div + 1` cycles, so the clock is the
//! system's over `2 * (div + 1)`.
//!
//! The chip select is a bit a program sets and clears rather than
//! something a transfer does, because every SPI command is several
//! bytes under one select: a read of this flash is a command byte,
//! three of address, a dummy, and then as many as are wanted.
//!
//! The four modes are the two bits they always are. `cpol` is the
//! level the clock idles at. `cpha` says which of the two edges of a
//! bit carries it: with `cpha` clear the master samples on the leading
//! edge and moves its data on the trailing one, and with `cpha` set it
//! does the reverse. The one place that is not symmetric is the first
//! bit, which with `cpha` set has to be on the wire before the first
//! leading edge and must not be moved by it; the run counts half
//! edges, so that is the one leading edge it does not shift on.
