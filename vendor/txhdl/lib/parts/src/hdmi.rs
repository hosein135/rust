//! HDMI through an encoder chip: a video peripheral on AXI-Lite, and
//! the I2C master that configures the chip.
//!
//! The Alinx AX7A200B drives its HDMI connector through a SiI9134, which
//! takes pixels in parallel and does the TMDS encoding and the
//! serialising itself. What the FPGA gives it is a pixel clock, 24 bits
//! of colour, the horizontal and vertical syncs and a data enable, and
//! the chip is set up once over I2C before it shows anything.
//!
//! [`Hdmi`] is the video side, one unit on the pixel clock. It counts
//! the raster, reads its framebuffer under the beam, and drives the
//! chip's parallel inputs from registers. The framebuffer is written
//! over AXI-Lite, so a host paints the picture a pixel at a time and
//! the unit shows it for as long as it runs. Every number of the video
//! mode is a parameter, so a test can run a raster of a few hundred
//! pixels where the board runs one of 420 000.
//!
//! [`I2cInit`] holds the chip in reset, then writes its configuration
//! registers over I2C, and says whether every byte was acknowledged.
