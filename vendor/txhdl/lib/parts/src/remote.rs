//! A peripheral whose behaviour is a program somewhere else.
//!
//! [`Remote`] sits on AXI-Lite like any other peripheral, and answers
//! nothing itself. Every transaction it accepts leaves on a channel
//! as an [`Ask`], and the answer comes back on another as an
//! [`Answer`]. What is at the other end of those two channels is not
//! the peripheral's business: in a simulation it is a model in the
//! same program, and on a board it is a frame on a wire and a program
//! on another machine.
//!
//! That is what it is for. A peripheral being designed can be written
//! as software first, against the bus it will really sit on, with the
//! rest of the system running as it really runs; when the software is
//! right, the hardware replaces it and nothing else changes. See
//! issue 297.
//!
//! What the bus sees is a slow device. One transaction is outstanding
//! at a time, and the channel that carries it is held until the
//! answer arrives, which is what AXI-Lite allows and what a program
//! on the other side of a wire needs.
//!
//! A device that never answers cannot be allowed to stop the bus, so
//! a transaction that goes unanswered for `T` cycles is answered
//! `SlvErr` here. Each carries a tag, and an answer whose tag is not
//! the one outstanding is dropped, which is what makes the timeout
//! safe: the answer that arrives too late belongs to a transaction
//! the bus has already finished with.
