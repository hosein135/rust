//! The platform-level interrupt controller: `Plic<N, EDGE>`, one unit
//! for every count of sources, with `Plic1` to `Plic8` naming the
//! counts.
//!
//! It is the RISC-V PLIC with two targets, the hart's machine mode and
//! its supervisor mode (issue 1013), an AXI-Lite peripheral at the
//! standard offsets from its base:
//!
//! | offset      | word                                             |
//! |-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! | `0x4 * i`   | source `i`'s priority, 0 to 7; 0 never interrupts |
//! | `0x1000`    | the pending bits, bit `i` for source `i`; read only |
//! | `0x2000`    | the machine target's enable bits, the same way   |
//! | `0x2080`    | the supervisor target's enable bits              |
//! | `0x20_0000` | the machine target's threshold                   |
//! | `0x20_0004` | its claim on a read, complete on a write         |
//! | `0x20_1000` | the supervisor target's threshold                |
//! | `0x20_1004` | its claim and complete                           |
//!
//! The two targets share the sources, their gateways and the pending
//! bits; each has its own enables, threshold and line. A claim by
//! either takes the source's request, and a complete by either ends its
//! service, so a source enabled for both is served by whichever claims
//! first. The supervisor line is `mip.SEIP`'s, which reaches the core
//! with its supervisor mode (issue 1012).
//!
//! Every other offset reads as zero and ignores a write. Sources are
//! numbered from 1; source 0 does not exist, and its bits read zero.
//!
//! A source's line goes through a gateway first. A level source asks
//! while its line is high, and an edge source, one whose bit is set in
//! the `EDGE` parameter, asks on a rising edge. A request goes forward
//! and becomes pending only when the source has no request in service,
//! from the claim that took the last one to the complete that ended
//! it; an edge that comes during the service is held, one deep, and
//! asks on the complete. A level source whose line is still high on
//! the complete asks again at once.
//!
//! A read of the claim word answers with the number of the pending,
//! enabled source of the highest priority above the threshold, the
//! lowest number winning a tie, and clears its pending bit; it answers
//! 0 when there is none. Writing that number back is the complete.
//! Each target's line is a register, high a cycle after its claim would
//! answer with a source. A write ignores its strobe.
