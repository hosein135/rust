//! A read-only window onto an SPI flash: a read on the bus becomes a
//! fast read on the wires, and the word comes back.
//!
//! The SPI master in `spi` is what a program drives byte by byte. This
//! is the other way of reaching the same chip: an address range in
//! which an ordinary read is answered with what the flash holds there,
//! with no registers to drive and nothing for software to sequence. A
//! bootloader reads a program out of it, and a core that fetches from
//! the bus can run from it, without a resynthesis to change what is
//! there (issue 146).
//!
//! A read at offset `a` sends the fast read command `0x0b`, the three
//! bytes of `a` with its low two bits cleared, one byte the chip
//! throws away, and then takes four bytes, which are the word, lowest
//! address in the lowest byte. Nine bytes on the wires for four on the
//! bus: the window trades time for needing no software at all, and a
//! cache in front of it is the answer if that matters.
//!
//! The wires are mode 0, which is what every flash answers a fast read
//! in: the clock idles low, the chip takes a bit on the rising edge
//! and the master moves one on the falling. The select is held low for
//! the whole of a read and released after it, so each read is a
//! command of its own.
//!
//! A read burst of incrementing words is a fast read a word, each
//! started as the word before it goes, with the select raised between
//! them, and the burst gets every beat it asked for (issue 1208).
//!
//! A write is answered `SLVERR`, once, after every beat of it has been
//! taken. The window is read only, which is what makes it safe to
//! fetch from: nothing on the bus can change what the instruction
//! stream is reading.
