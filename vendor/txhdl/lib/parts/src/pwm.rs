//! Pulse width modulation: four outputs that are high for a chosen
//! part of every period.
//!
//! A digital pin is on or off, and much of what a board drives wants
//! something in between: an LED at a third of its brightness, a fan at
//! half its speed, a servo told where to stand. Switching fast enough
//! that the load cannot follow gives the in-between, and what the load
//! sees is the fraction of each period the pin was high.
//!
//! The registers, a word apart from the base, are declared once with
//! `regmap!` below (issue 674): the control word and its fields, the
//! period, a duty per channel, and the counter, which a program may
//! read to see where in the period it is.
//!
//! A duty written takes effect at the end of the period rather than at
//! once. A period that changed under a counter halfway through would
//! make one pulse of neither the old width nor the new, which is a
//! runt: a load that averages sees a step it was never told about, and
//! a servo reads it as a command. So a write goes to a shadow, and
//! every shadow is loaded together when the counter wraps.
//!
//! Two shapes of pulse, chosen by `ctrl`. Edge aligned counts up and
//! wraps, so every pulse starts at the same moment and the ends move
//! as the duty does. Centre aligned counts up and then back down, so a
//! pulse is centred in its period and both edges move; a bank of
//! outputs driven that way does not switch all at once, which is what
//! a power supply prefers.
//!
//! The ends are exact. A duty of zero is a pin that never goes high,
//! and a duty of the period or more is a pin that never comes down;
//! neither is a pulse one cycle wide.
