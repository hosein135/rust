//! A general I2C master on AXI-Lite, and a model of a device to check
//! it against.
//!
//! `I2cInit` of [`hdmi`](crate::hdmi) replays a fixed list of writes
//! and cannot read. This master is the other kind: a program says what
//! one piece of a transaction is and the master does it, so a driver
//! can address a device, write to it, turn the bus around and read
//! from it.
//!
//! The four registers and their fields are declared once with
//! `regmap!` below (issue 676): `ctrl`, `cmd`, `data` and `state`.
//!
//! A quarter of a bit takes `div + 1` cycles, so the bus runs at the
//! system clock over `4 * (div + 1)`: 249 is 100 kbit/s from 100 MHz,
//! and 62 is 400.
//!
//! `cmd` is bit 0 a start, bit 1 a stop, bit 2 a write, bit 3 a read,
//! bit 4 the answer to give after a read (set for a NACK, which is
//! what a master sends after the last byte it wants), and bits 8 to 15
//! the byte to write. One command is at most a start, one byte either
//! way, and a stop, which is how a driver writes an address and then
//! reads: `start|write` with the address, then `start|read|nack` with
//! the repeated start.
//!
//! `state` bit 1 is written with one to clear, as is bit 2 and bit 3;
//! a command clears all three itself. The interrupt is bit 1 while the
//! enable is set.
//!
//! The two lines are open drain. `scl_low` and `sda_low` high pull a
//! line low, and a line nobody pulls is high through the board's
//! pull-up, so a board wrapper drives a pad from each and reads the
//! pad back into `scl_in` and `sda_in`. The master watches both: a
//! device that holds the clock low stretches it, and the master waits
//! rather than counting; a data line that reads low while the master
//! released it is another master winning the bus, which sets
//! arbitration lost and ends the command.
