//! What a link carries: one beat of one AXI channel, addressed to a
//! node and stamped with the node it came from.
//!
//! A packet is one shape, as wide as the widest beat needs, for the
//! same reason Razboj's instruction is: every field a step reads has
//! to be at a fixed place, and a link that carried a header and then
//! a body would want a sequencer at both ends before anything else
//! worked. A read address beat leaves the data and the strobe at
//! zero; a write response leaves the address at zero. [`Chan`] says
//! which fields mean anything.
