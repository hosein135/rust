//! The five-port switch: one per virtual channel, and two of them
//! make a node.
//!
//! Four ports are the links to the neighbours and the fifth is the
//! exit. Routing is dimension order: a packet goes east or west until
//! it is in its destination's column, then north or south until it is
//! at its node, and then out of the exit. On a lattice that is
//! deadlock free with nothing else said, because a packet never turns
//! from Y back into X and so no cycle of waiting can form.
//!
//! One packet moves per cycle. Each input's direction and the room at
//! the output it wants are worked out first, so an input whose output
//! is full does not hold up the others, and the choice among those
//! that can move is a round robin: the first input at or after the
//! one whose turn it is, going round, and the turn moves on to the
//! one after whichever moved. So an input waits on at most four
//! others, however busy they are.
//!
//! It was a fixed order, the four links and then the exit, which
//! starved: an input that offered every cycle kept its output, and
//! the exit, last in the order, moved nothing at all while a link
//! through the node was busy. That was issue 315.
