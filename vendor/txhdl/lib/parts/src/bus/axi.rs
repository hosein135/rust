//! An AXI4 link: five channels, two ends, and a client that never
//! sees a channel.
//!
//! [`axi`] is to AXI what [`chan`] is to one transaction. It makes
//! every wire of a link at once and hands back two ends, a [`Host`]
//! and a [`Per`], and the ports of the two units that sit between
//! them. A client of either end is written as waiting on AXI
//! transactions: the host issues a burst and awaits its answer, the
//! peripheral accepts a whole decoded transaction and answers it.
//! Neither writes an identifier, counts a beat, watches `last`, or
//! names `aw`, `w`, `b`, `ar` or `r`.
//!
//! The layering, from a client down to the wire:
//!
//! ```text
//!     host client        issue / beat / grant / done  transaction level
//!     AxiHost            #[lower], replaceable
//!        aw ar w b r     the AXI4 channels, where a router goes
//!     AxiPer             #[lower], replaceable
//!     peripheral client  req / write data / answer    transaction level
//! ```
//!
//! [`AxiHost`] and [`AxiPer`] are units written in the lowered
//! subset, so each is a netlist as well as a simulation, and each
//! lowers to a module whose ports are the AXI channels a synthesis
//! tool expects. Between them is real AXI, which is where routing
//! attaches. Either may be replaced by a unit of the same ports: the
//! port types are named ([`HostIn`], [`HostOut`], [`PerIn`],
//! [`PerOut`]) so that a design may supply its own.
//!
//! The widths are stated rather than computed, as they are
//! everywhere in this library, because `U<{D / 8}>` needs nightly
//! Rust: `A` is the address width, `D` the data width, `S` the
//! strobe width, which is `D / 8`, `I` the identifier width and
//! `NIDS` the count of identifiers, which is `1 << I`.
