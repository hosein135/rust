//! A scanout from memory: the video's lines read from DDR3 a line
//! ahead of the beam (issue 151).
//!
//! The pieces are in [`crate::dma`] and [`crate::cdc`]: `LineFetch`
//! reads a run of memory in bursts into a channel on the bus clock,
//! and `ChanCdc` carries the words to the pixel clock. This adds the
//! two ends that make them a scanout.
//!
//! [`LinePair`] is on the pixel clock, beside the raster. It holds two
//! lines: the beam reads one while the other fills, and they change
//! places at the start of each line. At that start it asks for the
//! line after the one about to be shown, so a line is fetched during
//! the whole of the line before it. It asks for nothing while the
//! scanout is not shown, and once it is, it asks for a frame's first
//! line, from the base, before any other: out of a reset the next
//! line's address is zero, and the line there is the boot memory's,
//! whose one-beat answer to a burst hung the fetch for good on the
//! board (issue 1178). So the picture starts with the first frame
//! whose last row begins after the bit that shows it.
//!
//! The frame's base address is a register taken at the vertical sync,
//! so a host that draws into one buffer and shows another flips them
//! with one write. A column the beam reads before its word has arrived
//! sets `starved`, a sticky bit a host reads and clears, so a run on the
//! board can show that no line ever starved rather than argue it, and is
//! shown as [`LATE`], magenta, rather than as whatever word the line
//! before left there (issue 1209). A word belongs to the line it was
//! asked for, which the lines owed say (issue 1233): a line that starts
//! before it has come whole takes the rest of its words into the half
//! the beam reads, so its columns fill in as they come, and a line
//! whose time has passed has the rest of its words dropped, rather than
//! either landing in the half filling, where the next row would show
//! them as its own. A line
//! asked for that gets no word for two line times sets `stuck`, sticky
//! too, with the line's address: a fetch that hangs says so, where on
//! the board it once showed only as a black screen with `starved`
//! clear (issue 1197).
//!
//! [`ScanFetch`] is on the bus clock. It takes the line requests the
//! pixel side sends across and starts `LineFetch` on each, one at a
//! time.
//!
//! What a line must survive is the memory's worst latency, which on
//! the board is the MIG in `//ddr3`: an MT41K256M16 at 2.5 ns a clock,
//! `ddr3/mig/ddr3_mig.prj`, whose refresh takes tRFC = 260 ns once
//! every tREFI = 7.8 us, and whose bank miss is tRP + tRCD = 27.5 ns
//! before the CAS latency of six clocks, 15 ns. A read that meets a
//! refresh and then a miss waits about 300 ns plus the controller's
//! own pipeline. The board's mode is 640 by 480, 31.8 us a line of
//! 800 columns, and a visible line is 640 words. A line has the whole
//! of the previous one to arrive in, and a refresh lands about four
//! times in it, so the margin is the line time against the bursts, the
//! other hosts' turns between them and four refreshes, not a burst's
//! latency against a pixel. The flagship fetches a line in ten bursts
//! of 64 beats rather than forty of sixteen, since a burst pays the
//! path's latency and its turn at the arbiter once (issue 1209): in the
//! board's simulation, under the core copying in the DDR3 and the
//! Ethernet port sending, a line took 4682 cycles of its 3175 in
//! bursts of sixteen, and takes 1206.
