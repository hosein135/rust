//! Two parts for running one design twice: a stream sent to both
//! copies, and a stream taken from both and checked.
//!
//! A machine that must not be quietly wrong runs two of itself and
//! compares. The comparison is only worth something if both copies see
//! exactly the same inputs, in the same cycles, and if neither can run
//! ahead of the other; both of those are what these two parts are for.
//!
//! `Tee` sends one stream to two receivers: each takes the held word in
//! its own cycle, and the next word comes in only once both have taken
//! it, so neither copy is more than a word ahead. `Check` takes a
//! word from each copy, in the same cycle, passes the first copy's on,
//! and raises a line that stays raised when the two differ.
//!
//! Neither holds the stream up otherwise. A `Tee` registers the word
//! it is passing, so that its netlist has no combinational path from
//! one side's handshake to the other's, and a `Check` holds one bit,
//! which is the disagreement it saw.
