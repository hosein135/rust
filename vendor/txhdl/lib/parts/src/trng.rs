//! An entropy source: ring oscillators sampled, folded, debiased,
//! checked and buffered behind AXI-Lite.
//!
//! A network stack wants numbers nobody can predict, and a machine
//! that has no clock of the day and boots into the same state every
//! time has nowhere to get them but physics (issue 458). The physics
//! here is the jitter of ring oscillators: a loop of an odd number of
//! inverters runs at a rate set by its own gates, wandering with the
//! temperature and the supply, and where the clock's edge catches it
//! in its period is not something a program can know. That half is
//! [`RingOsc`], a Verilog module the netlist instantiates and does
//! not write, since a loop of gates is not a thing this language
//! says; in a Rust run it is a model, a shift register with feedback,
//! which is stated here so that nobody reads a simulation as proof of
//! randomness. Only a board proves that, and issue 458 says how far
//! this has been measured.
//!
//! The other half, [`Trng`], is ordinary hardware and is lowered. Each
//! cycle it folds the rings' samples to one bit by exclusive or, which
//! makes a bit less biased than any one ring's. It then does three
//! things with the stream:
//!
//! * **Watches it.** A ring that has stopped, or been made to stop,
//!   gives the same bit for ever, and a source that keeps handing out
//!   words then is worse than none. The repetition count test of NIST
//!   SP 800-90B is a counter: [`RCT_CUTOFF`] identical bits in a row
//!   raise a sticky fault, the buffer stops filling, and a host reads
//!   why in `status`. The cutoff is `1 + 20 / H` for a false alarm rate
//!   of one in a million at a min-entropy `H` of half a bit per
//!   sample, rounded to forty. The adaptive proportion test of the
//!   same standard, section 4.4.2, catches a source gone biased
//!   without going stuck: in each window of [`APT_WINDOW`] samples it
//!   counts how many equal the window's first, and [`APT_CUTOFF`] of
//!   them raise a sticky fault of its own (issue 918). Both watch the
//!   binary samples, the rings XORed to one bit, before the extractor.
//! * **Debiases it.** Von Neumann's extractor takes the stream in
//!   pairs: `01` gives a zero, `10` a one, and `00` and `11` give
//!   nothing. A bias in the source cancels, since the two orders of a
//!   pair are equally likely whatever the bias is, at the cost of
//!   three bits in four on average.
//! * **Buffers it.** The bits that survive are shifted into a word,
//!   and whole words go into a buffer of four, which a host reads a
//!   word at a time. A word that finds the buffer full is dropped; the
//!   source makes more.
//!
//! | Offset | Name | What it is |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0x0` | `data` | a word of entropy, taken by the read; zero if none |
//! | `0x4` | `status` | bit 0 a word is ready, bits 3 to 1 how many, bit 8 the repetition count fault, bit 9 running, bit 10 the adaptive proportion fault |
//! | `0x8` | `ctrl` | bit 0 run; a write with bit 1 clears both faults |
//! | `0xc` | `raw` | the last 32 folded samples, before the extractor |
//! | `0x10` | `cap` | a write of bit 0 starts a capture; bit 1 busy, bit 2 done |
//! | `0x14` | `capidx` | which captured word `capword` reads, 0 to 255 |
//! | `0x18` | `capword` | that captured word, 32 samples, the newest in bit 0 |
//!
//! `raw` is for the measurement and nothing else: a program that
//! reads it in a loop and sends the bits up the serial line is how the
//! source's bias and its entropy are estimated on the board.
//!
//! A read of `raw` sees 32 samples, and a loop on the board cannot
//! read it again within 32 cycles, so the samples of two reads never
//! meet and nothing longer than a window can be measured that way.
//! The capture is the long measurement: a write of `cap` fills a
//! buffer of `CAP_WORDS` words from the samples as they come, one word
//! every 32 cycles while the source runs, so the words are 8192
//! samples in a row with none missing, and a program reads them out
//! afterwards at any pace (#817). It is a measurement aid; the
//! extractor and the health test run on regardless.
