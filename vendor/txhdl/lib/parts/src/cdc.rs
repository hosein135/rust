//! A channel from one clock to another, in the lowered subset.
//!
//! Two processes, one per clock, sharing a memory and four registers.
//! The writing side owns `wbin` and `wgray`, the reading side owns
//! `rbin` and `rgray`, and each side keeps the other's Gray pointer
//! through two flip-flops of its own clock. That pair of flops is the
//! crossing: everything else on each side reads only its own domain.
//!
//! The pointers are Gray coded because a binary pointer changes
//! several bits at once and the other side samples it at an unrelated
//! moment. `7 -> 8` is `0111 -> 1000`, four bits at once, and a sample
//! caught between them can read any of sixteen values, including ones
//! the pointer never held. A Gray code changes one bit per step, so a
//! sample caught mid-change reads either the old value or the new one,
//! and both are safe: the reader concludes the queue is emptier than
//! it is, the writer that it is fuller, and each is wrong in the
//! direction that refuses work rather than corrupting it.
//!
//! The pointers are one bit wider than the address so that full and
//! empty can be told apart. Empty is the two pointers equal. Full is
//! the two pointers equal in every bit but the top two, which in Gray
//! is what one lap apart means.
//!
//! What this cannot say: nothing here models metastability. Both
//! sides are deterministic, the sampling clock reads a register that
//! has settled, and the two flops are never seen to do anything. A
//! passing co-simulation says the two implementations agree on the
//! protocol, cycle by cycle, and says nothing at all about whether
//! the silicon is safe. What the second flop is for is exactly the
//! thing the test cannot see.
//!
//! `lib/board/chan_cdc.v` is the hand-written Verilog this is shaped
//! after, nine instances of which are in the flagship. Replacing it
//! is a separate decision (issue 370): that file is proven on
//! hardware and this one is not.
