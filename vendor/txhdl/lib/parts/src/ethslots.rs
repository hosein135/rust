//! The registers a Zephyr Ethernet driver talks to.
//!
//! The map is LiteEth's, from `drivers/ethernet/eth_litex_liteeth.c`
//! in Zephyr, so that the driver is a port rather than a design. Two
//! slots per direction, ping-pong, each a flat buffer of
//! [`crate::eth::FRAME_MAX`] bytes, which is 2048 and exactly
//! LiteEth's `0x800`.
//!
//! # Where the buffers are, and why it matters
//!
//! LiteEth's slots are SRAM inside the peripheral, and its driver
//! copies each frame into them over the bus. That is the ceiling this
//! is meant to lift: a frame copied a word at a time by the processor
//! is the processor doing a memcpy it should not be doing.
//!
//! So the slots here are a region of main memory instead, at
//! `BASE`, and the peripheral fetches from it with
//! [`crate::dma::LineFetch`] and fills it with
//! [`crate::dma::LineStore`]. The driver cannot tell: it is told a
//! base address for the buffers in its device tree either way, and it
//! writes a frame there and then writes `tx_start`. What changes is
//! who moves the bytes from there to the wire.
//!
//! # No transmit interrupt
//!
//! LiteEth's driver disables it and polls `tx_ready` instead, because
//! Zephyr's send is allowed to block. So the transmit side is a ready
//! bit and a start bit, and only receive raises a line. `tx_ev_pending`
//! and `tx_ev_enable` exist because the driver acknowledges them, and
//! do nothing else.
