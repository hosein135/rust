//! Between the words an engine moves and the bytes a frame counts.
//!
//! [`crate::dma::LineFetch`] and [`crate::dma::LineStore`] move
//! 32-bit words, because that is what the bus moves. An Ethernet
//! frame is a count of bytes, and not usually a whole number of
//! words: anything from 64 to 1518 bytes, so its last word holds
//! one, two or three real bytes as often as four.
//!
//! These two units are that difference, and nothing else. Neither
//! touches the bus and neither knows where the frame is in memory.
//! `FrameOut` takes words from a fetch engine and gives the
//! transmitter bytes, the last of them marked. `FrameIn` takes the
//! receiver's bytes and gives a store engine words.
//!
//! # Why the count is carried rather than inferred
//!
//! A word tells you nothing about how many of its bytes are real, so
//! the byte count has to arrive beside the words. On the way out it
//! comes from `tx_length`, which the driver wrote. On the way in it
//! comes from the receiver, which knows the frame's length before it
//! offers the first byte of it, because it takes a whole frame and
//! checks it before offering any of it.
//!
//! Getting that wrong is quiet rather than loud. Three bytes too many
//! puts whatever the channel was carrying on the wire, or into memory
//! past the end of the frame, and the frame still looks well formed
//! going past.
