//! port is one side of a channel; the channel itself, the elastic
//! buffer of two between two units, is the first part here; a FIFO
//! with a channel at each end and a reservation station are the

// As in the runtime crate: every public item is documented and the
// build refuses one that is not. A part written by a macro is
// documented by its generator, so the text arrives with the code.
