//! An MDIO master on AXI-Lite, the management interface of an Ethernet
//! PHY, and a model of a PHY to check it against (issue 864).
//!
//! MDIO is IEEE 802.3 clause 22: a clock, MDC, which the master always
//! drives, and one data line, MDIO, which the master drives except
//! while the PHY answers a read. A frame is 32 ones of preamble and
//! then 32 bits, high bit first: the start `01`, the operation (`10` a
//! read, `01` a write), the PHY's address in five bits, the register's
//! in five, two bits of turnaround, and the sixteen bits of data. On a
//! read the master lets go of the line for the turnaround, the PHY
//! drives a zero in its second bit, and then the data.
//!
//! The four registers and their fields are declared once with
//! `regmap!` below: `ctrl`, `cmd`, `data` and `state`.
//!
//! Half of an MDC cycle is `div + 1` system cycles, so MDC is the
//! system clock over `2 * (div + 1)`: 49 is 1 MHz from 100 MHz. 802.3
//! allows MDC up to 2.5 MHz. `div` resets to zero, which is far too
//! fast for any PHY, so a driver writes `ctrl` before its first frame.
//!
//! Writing `cmd` starts a frame: bits 0 to 4 the register, 5 to 9 the
//! PHY's address, bit 10 set for a write, and bits 16 to 31 the word
//! to write. `state` bit 0 is busy; bit 1 is set when a frame ends and
//! is written with one to clear; a command clears it itself. `data` is
//! the word the last read took, once busy has fallen.
//!
//! A bit is set on the line while MDC is low and taken by the PHY as
//! MDC rises. The master takes a bit the PHY drives at the end of the
//! low half, just before MDC rises, which is a whole MDC cycle after
//! the PHY changed it: 802.3 gives the PHY up to 300 ns for that, and
//! at 1 MHz there are 1000.
//!
//! The line is three-state. `mdio_out` is the level and `mdio_oe` high
//! drives it, so a board wrapper drives the pad from the two and reads
//! the pad back into `mdio_in`. 802.3 asks for a pull-up on MDIO, so
//! that a line nobody drives reads one; the flagship sets the FPGA's
//! own on the pad.
