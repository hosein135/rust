//! A native-mode SD card host on AXI-Lite, and a model of a card to
//! check it against.
//!
//! A card in SPI mode is a few hundred kilobytes a second on one data
//! line, which is what [`crate::spi`] gives. The native mode is the
//! card's own protocol: a command line, `CMD`, that carries 48-bit
//! commands out and 48- or 136-bit responses back, and one or four
//! data lines, `DAT`, that carry blocks of 512 bytes either way, each
//! line with a CRC-16 of its own, at up to 25 MHz here once the card
//! is up. Every command carries a CRC-7, and so does every response but
//! the one to `ACMD41`, whose CRC field is all ones (issue 153).
//!
//! The host here does one command at a time, and with it at most one
//! block. A program writes the argument and the command word, and the
//! command word says what follows: no response, a short one or a long
//! one; a block to read after it or a block to write; whether to waited
//! for the card's busy line afterwards; and whether to check the
//! response's CRC. The host sends the command, takes the response,
//! moves the block through a buffer of 128 words that the program
//! reads or fills through one register, and says in `status` how it
//! went. A multi-block transfer is one command, `CMD18` or `CMD25`,
//! followed by data-only transfers, one a block, and `CMD12`; a card
//! streams a read back to back, and keeping up with that at 25 MHz
//! through a register is what the host's way to memory is for.
//!
//! That way is two engines of issue 151 beside the host, and a count of
//! blocks in `blocks` (issue 912). A command with a count runs that many
//! blocks on its own: the buffer becomes a ring between the lines and
//! an engine, a read's words go to the store engine as they arrive and
//! a write's come from the fetch engine, each block sent once all of it
//! is in, and the command is done once its engine has finished too. A
//! command is a read or a write and never both, and none starts until
//! the last has finished, so the two engines never run at once.
//!
//! | Offset | Name | What it is |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0x00` | `ctrl` | divider, four lines, interrupt enable; bit 10 clears |
//! | `0x04` | `cmd` | index, response, transfer, checks; written, it starts |
//! | `0x08` | `arg` | the argument |
//! | `0x0c` | `status` | busy, done, faults, CRC status, busy line, pointers |
//! | `0x10` to `0x1c` | `resp0` to `resp3` | the response |
//! | `0x20` | `data` | read: the next word out; written: the next word in |
//! | `0x24` | `dma` | where in memory the next command's blocks start |
//! | `0x28` | `blocks` | blocks to move through memory, those left, engine running |
//!
//! `ctrl` is the divider in bits 0 to 7, `wide` in bit 8 and the
//! interrupt enable in bit 9. A half of a card clock takes `div + 1`
//! cycles, so the card's clock is the system's over `2 * (div + 1)`:
//! at 100 MHz, 124 is 400 kHz for the start, 3 is 12.5 MHz and 1 is
//! 25 MHz. A divider of 0 runs as 1, since the host's work trails the
//! clock and a half of one cycle would put its driving and its
//! sampling on one cycle (issue 929).
//!
//! `cmd` is the index in bits 0 to 5, the response in bits 6 and 7
//! (0 none, 1 short, 2 long), read in bit 8, write in bit 9, waited for
//! busy in bit 10, skip the response's CRC in bit 11, data only in
//! bit 12, which sends no command and moves a block, and clocks alone
//! in bit 13, which runs eighty clocks with the command line held high
//! and nothing else: a card wants at least 74 of those after power-up
//! before its first command.
//!
//! `status` is busy in bit 0, done in bit 1, a response that never
//! came in bit 2, a response whose CRC was wrong in bit 3, a block
//! that never came or a card that never left busy in bit 4, a block
//! whose CRC was wrong, or that the card refused, in bit 5, the card's
//! three CRC status bits in bits 6 to 8, the data line's level in bit
//! 9, the response's index in bits 10 to 15, the write pointer in bits
//! 16 to 23 and the read pointer in bits 24 to 31. Writing bit 1
//! clears done and the faults.
//!
//! Timing is the card's: the host drives its lines after the falling
//! edge of the clock it makes and samples the card's after the rising
//! edge, and the card does the same. The host drives a cycle after the
//! fall, and samples two cycles after the rise, from input registers
//! that took the lines a cycle after it, each a register the pad feeds
//! and nothing else, so that it packs into the IOB. So a card has the
//! half clock and a cycle to answer in, 30 ns at 25 MHz, against the
//! 20 ns it had when the host sampled on the rise itself through the
//! logic behind the pad, which the clock's way out, the card's 14 ns
//! at default speed and the way back did not fit (issue 929). A CRC is checked the way a shift
//! register does it: the received CRC is fed into the same register
//! after the data, and what is left is zero when they agree.
