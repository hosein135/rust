//! A process of several waits, lowered to a state machine (issue 501).
//!
//! A loop body that waits more than once is cut at its waits into
//! segments, one per wait, and the segments are the states of a
//! machine: a hidden register, `at_wait`, holds the number of the
//! wait the process is at, and each segment's statements happen at
//! the edge when the register holds its number and the wait's own
//! condition holds. The register then moves to the next wait, and
//! after the last it moves back to the first, which is the loop.
//!
//! What a segment may hold is what a loop of one wait may hold after
//! its wait, with the differences a state brings:
//!
//! * a register is driven inside the state's arm, so it changes only
//!   at the edge that leaves the state;
//! * a `send` offers while the process is in the state and its wait's
//!   condition holds, so `valid` is the state's condition, and a
//!   channel sent from several states offers the state's data;
//! * a receive takes in its state alone, so `ready` is the state's
//!   condition;
//! * an output port keeps what a state set until a state sets it
//!   again, as the run's wire does, so it is held in a register the
//!   unit does not declare, `<port>_held`, set in the state's arm; the
//!   port is the state's expression while the state is about to leave
//!   and the register otherwise, which is the run's wire seen a cycle
//!   ahead, as every wire of the netlist is;
//! * a `let` is a wire too, and a wire computed in one state is not
//!   what it was by the next, so a name bound in one segment is not
//!   read in a later one; what crosses a wait is held in a register.
//!
//! A `for` whose body waits is a counted loop: its states once, and a
//! register the unit does not declare counting the turns, so its
//! bound may be anything `lowered` can evaluate. A body whose waits
//! are all under `if` may take no edge on a turn, so such a loop is
//! unrolled instead, a state per turn, and its bounds are written
//! out. A `for` that does not wait is left to the state's own
//! lowering.
//!
//! A wait under `if` is a state with a way around it: the state before
//! the `if` goes to the wait inside when the condition holds at its
//! edge and past the `if` otherwise, so its next value is a choice.
//! What sits in an arm before its wait happens in the state before
//! the `if`, under the arm's condition; what follows the `if` happens
//! in every state the `if` can end in, and is lowered once for all of
//! them, under the union of their conditions.
//!
//! Every wait is on one clock and one edge, since the machine is one
//! clocked block.
