//! Operators that may take a cycle. Every one is `async`, and every one
//! is a pipeline stage the moment it is awaited. They live here and not
//! beside the combinational ones so that the module a design imports
//! from says whether an operation can cost time.
//!
//! There is no `impl Add`. An operator must return a value, and an
//! operation whose latency the mapping decides cannot. `.await` is not a
//! claim that a cycle is spent; it is a refusal to decide here.
//!
//! Widths are declared per function rather than computed, because
//! `U<{A + B}>` needs nightly Rust. The prototype pays that in
//! functions; a nightly build could pay it once.
