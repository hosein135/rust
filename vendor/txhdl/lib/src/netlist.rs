//! A structural netlist, from the same walk the waveform uses. Every
//! unit is a module, every register a `reg`, and every wire or channel
//! whose ends are fields of different units is a net between them,
//! with a port on each and a wire in their common parent. The walk
//! sees fields, so a unit whose ports are fields yields ports, and a
//! unit that takes its ports as parameters of `run` yields only its
//! registers: that is the gap between a structural netlist and the
//! lowering, which the proc-macro route closes by reading the
//! `Unit` impl. The structural walk carries no behaviour, and its
//! bodies are empty; the behaviour is the rest of this module:
//! [`Lowered`], which `#[lower]` fills from the `Unit` impl with the
//! unit's ports, registers and processes, and the Verilog and VHDL
//! written from it.
