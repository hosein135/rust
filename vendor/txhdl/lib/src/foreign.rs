//! A foreign module as a unit. A Verilog module is compiled by
//! Verilator into a C++ model; a C shim over it, written by
//! `//tools/vshim` from the module's ports, gives the model a handle,
//! sets and reads its ports by index, settles it and pulses its clock;
//! and a unit, written by the same tool, drives the shim once per
//! rising edge: the inputs in as the edge left them, a settle, the
//! transfers the module agrees to on its channels, the edge, and the
//! outputs out. So the module is a registered unit like any other,
//! goes first in the join order like one, and the rest of the design
//! is none the wiser. `verilog_unit()` in `lib/foreign.bzl` builds
//! the three from the one file.
//!
//! A VHDL entity goes the same way with nvc as the engine, run as a
//! child process, since nvc is a program and not a library: the tool
//! writes a testbench around the entity that reads a line per step
//! from its standard input, a command and the inputs as hex, applies
//! them, settles or pulses the clock, and writes the outputs back as
//! one line; `Cosim` runs the nvc test script the build made of that
//! testbench and speaks the lines. The same generated unit drives
//! either engine, since both answer to set, get, settle and edge.
//! `vhdl_unit()` builds the testbench, the script and the crate.
