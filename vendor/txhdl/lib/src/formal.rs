//! Assertions, assumptions and cover points: what a unit states about
//! itself, checked by the run as it goes and written into the netlist
//! for a simulator or a formal tool to check again (issue 502).
//!
//! Every other check in this crate compares: the netlist must do what
//! the Rust run did. That catches a lowering that is wrong, and says
//! nothing about a design whose Rust is wrong in the same way as its
//! netlist. A statement of what must hold is a check of the design
//! itself, and a formal tool can prove it for every input rather than
//! for the one run.
//!
//! Three statements, each a macro so that it reads as a statement in a
//! unit's `run`, each a condition and a message:
//!
//! - [`check!`](crate::check): the condition holds on every edge the
//!   statement is reached. The run panics with the message when it does
//!   not.
//! - [`assume!`](crate::assume): the condition is what the unit may
//!   take for granted of its inputs. A formal tool proves the checks
//!   under it and nothing else; the run, which cannot constrain its
//!   inputs, panics when its own inputs break it, since the proof would
//!   not cover that run.
//! - [`cover!`](crate::cover): the condition can happen. The run counts
//!   how often it did, and [`covered`] says; a formal tool looks for a
//!   trace that reaches it.
//!
//! Under `#[lower]` each is a statement of the process it is in, under
//! the conditions it is under, and is stated only while `rst` is low,
//! so that nothing is checked while the unit is held in reset, whether
//! the netlist added the reset or the unit declared it (issue 633). The
//! run gates them the same way, on the reset a testbench asserts with
//! `set_reset`: while it is high a check and an assumption are not
//! checked and a cover point is not counted (issue 879).
//! In the Verilog it is SystemVerilog's immediate `assert`, `assume` or
//! `cover` inside the clocked block, between `` `ifdef FORMAL `` and
//! `` `endif ``: a formal tool such as SymbiYosys defines `FORMAL`, and
//! a tool that reads plain Verilog, a synthesis tool, never sees them.
//! In the VHDL a check and an assumption are VHDL-2008's own `assert`,
//! which a simulator checks, and a cover point is a `report` of its
//! message when it is reached.
