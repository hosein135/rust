// `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, is unsigned, yields a `bool`, and
// takes a literal on the right too: `count == 8`. Every one lowers to
// the operator of the same name, and every one works across limbs for
// a value wider than 128 bits, a limb at a time. What has no operator
// is a method: `sra`, the arithmetic shift, `lt_signed`, the signed
// compare, `mul::<M>`, the widening multiply, `concat::<_, M>`,
// `sext::<M>` and `zext::<M>`, each with a width that is the sum of two
// others stated, because that sum needs nightly Rust to write.
