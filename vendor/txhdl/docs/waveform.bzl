"""An example's waveform, drawn by the build.

Runs the example with `TXHDL_FST` set, so it prints as usual and writes
its FST as well; turns the FST into a signals database (vcdcvt, which
reads FST by the file's extension) and the
chosen signals into drawtiming text (sqlite2drawtiming), both prebuilt
tools pinned in //:multitool.lock.json; and draws the text as TikZ
(//tools/dt2tikz), in colour. Produces out_NAME.txt, NAME.dt and
NAME_timing.tex.
