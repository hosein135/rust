# The PHY's clock and the board's oscillator are unrelated, and so is
# everything derived from either: the receive half runs on the quarter
# cycle shift `eth_rgmii`'s MMCM makes from `eth_rxck`, and the only
# path between that and the transmit clock goes through `chan_cdc`,
# whose two sides are asynchronous by construction.
#
# Both groups say `-include_generated_clocks`. Naming `eth_rxck` alone
# leaves the shifted clock out of the group, so the Gray pointers
# crossing into the receive domain are timed against a clock that has
# nothing to do with them; on the echo design those paths happened to
# close, and on //flagship five of them missed by 365 ps. See issue
# #314.
