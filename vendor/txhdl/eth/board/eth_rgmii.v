// RGMII to GMII, for a gigabit PHY such as the JL2121 on the Alinx
// AX7A200B, on a Xilinx 7-series part.
//
// RGMII sends a GMII byte as two nibbles a cycle: the low nibble while
// the clock is high and the high nibble while it is low, with the valid
// line on the rising edge and valid xor error on the falling one. The
// FPGA's primitives do the two edges: an ODDR per line out and an IDDR
// per line in.
//
// Transmit: the byte and `tx_en` are taken on `clk125`, and the PHY's
// transmit clock is the same clock through the same kind of register,
// so the clock's edges leave the FPGA aligned with the data's. RGMII
// asks one side or the other to delay the clock into the middle of the
// data, and on this board the PHY does it. This wrapper used to supply
// a quarter cycle of its own as well, and the two delays together put
// the PHY's sampling edge where the data changes: the board received
// every frame and the host got most of them back with a bad check
// sequence, about one bit in ten thousand wrong. The vendor's own design
// for this board sends the clock edge-aligned, and pings through it
// without loss. See issue #231.
//
// Receive: `rx_clk`, the PHY's receive clock shifted as below, clocks
// the IDDRs and the receiving half of the MAC. The receive clock goes
// through an MMCM, which removes the delay of the global buffer behind
// it, and is shifted by `RX_CLOCK_PHASE`; the shift that centres the
// sampling edge depends on the PHY and the routing, and is 78.75 degrees
// on the flagship, where flagship/board/flagship_io.xdc times it.
//
// What the PHY does with its receive clock is known in part (#864).
//
// * Measured. Clocked through a plain global buffer, about 3.4 ns late,
//   the MAC accepted no frame (#231). Through the MMCM, shifts of 45 to
//   112.5 degrees received and 180 did not, and on October 3, 2026 the
//   flagship received at 78.75. Timed at the pins, those points fit a
//   PHY that sends its receive clock centred in the data, delayed about
//   2 ns, and not one that sends it on the data's edge; the run that
//   received nothing does not tell the two apart, since a buffer 3.4 ns
//   late samples where a centred source changes as well.
// * The chip. It answers MDIO at address 0 with the identifier
//   `937c 4032`, which JLSemi's Linux driver names `JL2XXX_PHY_ID`, its
//   gigabit family; its OUI field holds the low 22 bits of JLSemi's
//   OUI, 64-DF-10, as a plain number rather than in 802.3's bit order.
// * Its register. That driver puts the receive delay at bit 9, 2 ns, of
//   register 17 on page 3336, and leaves it as the chip powers up.
//   Nothing here reads it, since reading a page means writing the page
//   register, which is left for the user to allow.
// * Not known without the JL2121's data sheet: that bit's value at power
//   on, on this board, and so whether the centring is the PHY's own
//   delay or something on the board. A 2 ns difference in the traces
//   would be some thirty centimetres, so the PHY is the likely one.
//
// The shift is on the clock and not on the five data lines on
// purpose, and why is at the MMCM below. `RX_CLOCK_PHASE` is a parameter
// so that the shift can be moved without reading this file.
//
// Only gigabit works. At 100 or 10 Mbit a PHY sends one nibble per
// clock cycle and the MAC would have to take bytes over two cycles,
// which neither half of the MAC does.
