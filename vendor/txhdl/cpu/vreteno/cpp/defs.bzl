"""C++ compiled for Vreteno, and turned into an image the core runs.

The Rust side reaches the core through the ruleset's own toolchain and
a platform transition. C++ has no ruleset here, so the fetched
compiler is driven directly: one action compiles and links a
translation unit for this core, and a second turns the ELF into the
image, by the same tool and the same checks the Rust images go
through.
"""

# What this core is, in the compiler's words. `rv32imc` is the
# instruction set, compressed instructions included, `ilp32` the
# soft-float ABI, and both name the multilib of newlib and libstdc++
# the toolchain carries, so the standard library that gets linked is
# one built for this machine. `zicsr` is the control registers, which
# this assembler wants named before it will assemble a `csrwi`, and
# a program ends by writing one of them; it is an extension of the
# instruction set and not of the multilib, so the same libraries are
# still the ones linked.
_ARCH = [
    "-march=rv32imc_zicsr",
    "-mabi=ilp32",
]

# Why each of the rest. The instruction memory is 4 KiB, so size is
# not a preference. There is no unwinder and no operating system to
# unwind to, so exceptions are off; nothing reads a type at run time,
# so RTTI is off; and a static with a guard would call a lock that
# does not exist, so thread-safe statics are off. The entry point is
# the core's reset vector rather than a C runtime's, so the toolchain's
# own startup files are left out and the linker script says where
# everything goes.
