//! This is not a lockstep test, and it cannot be one. The model steps
//! when the core retires, so it knows how many instructions have gone
//! by and has no idea how many cycles the pipeline spent; a program
//! that read `mcycle` into a register would get a number from the core
//! that no model could produce without knowing the microarchitecture,
//! which is the thing the model exists not to know. So the counters
//! are checked here, against the core alone, on the properties a
