//! The core's interrupt controller, an AXI peripheral: the count and
//! the compare, each in two halves, and the software interrupt's one
//! bit, at the offsets every RISC-V platform puts them at, which is
//! what a stock port of an operating system looks for. It writes the
//! lanes a
//! write's strobe covers into the word addressed, answers a read with
//! the word in the cycle it takes the burst, and raises its interrupt
//! while the count has reached the compare, through a register, so
//! that the line is a register's output and the core sees in a cycle
//! what the timer decided the cycle before. The count runs from the
//! reset, one a cycle.
//!
//! The map is `regmap!`'s `clint`, below: `msip` at `0x0000`, the
//! compare at `0x4000` and the count at `0xbff8`, each in two halves,
//! low first. It writes the read mux and the write enables, and the
//! offsets `isa` and the tests address by (issue 668).
//!
//! The window is 64 KiB, which those offsets need, and the router
//! sends it only the bursts in it, so the decode is on the offset and
//! not on the whole address.
//!
//! It answers single beats, which is all the core and a stock driver
//! make. A burst of more than one beat is refused rather than cut
//! short: a read gets every beat it asked for, each `SlvErr`, and a
//! write has every beat taken and nothing written, then one `SlvErr`,
//! so a burst host's burst ends and the bus goes on (issue 1208).
