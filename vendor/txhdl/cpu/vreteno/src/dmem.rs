//! The data memory as an AXI peripheral: `W` words, 1024 at
//! `DATA_BASE` on the board, in four memories of a byte, one per lane,
//! so that a store of a byte or a half writes its lanes and reads
//! nothing. The board's stack memory was the same unit with 16384 words
//! (issue 1278), until it moved into the core, on its own port (issue
//! 1275).
//!
//! A read goes into the memory's own register at the edge, the
//! synchronous read a block RAM has, and is answered the cycle after.
//! A read burst of incrementing words is answered a beat a cycle, each
//! word read as the one before it goes, which is what the core's
//! instruction cache fills its lines with (issue 1021). A write is
//! held until its beat arrives, because AXI4 puts no identifier on the
//! write data channel. A write burst's beats go to consecutive words,
//! and the burst is answered once, after its last beat, so that a burst
//! host's beats never stay in the write channel behind an early answer
//! (issue 1208). The router sends this peripheral only the bursts in
//! its range, so it checks no address.
