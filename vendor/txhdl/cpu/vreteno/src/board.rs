//! The whole of the design that goes on the board, as one lowered unit.
//!
//! The core, its tracker, a router, and eight ranges behind the router,
//! from the boot memory at `0x0000` to the configuration flash, read
//! as memory, at `0x2000_0000`, which `BoardMap` names in the order of
//! the router's ports. The stack memory at `0x1_0000` (issue 1278) is
//! in the core, on its own port, and not on the bus (issue 1275). The third of them is the peripheral page: nine
//! slots of 256 bytes from `0x3000` behind an AXI-Lite bridge, which
//! `SlotMap` names. `//tools/memmap` writes both maps into the
//! documents from these types, so they are not listed again here
//! (#444). The platform-level interrupt controller's source 1 is the
//! serial port's receive interrupt, its source 2 the board's `irq`
//! input and its source 3 a frame arriving on the Ethernet port,
//! and its line is the core's external interrupt. `run.rs` wires
//! the same parts for a simulation, with a Rust `join` of their runs;
//! this is that wiring written as a unit of units, so `#[lower]` makes
//! its netlist, one module holding the rest, and the only thing a board
//! top has to do by hand is the clocks, the reset and the pins.
//!
//! The DDR3 controller is a foreign module inside it, so the netlist
//! names the controller's wrapper and does not write it, and the
//! memory's pins, the data and strobe pads among them, are this unit's
//! own ports, as are the board's clock going in and the design's clock
//! coming out, since the controller makes it. `DIV` is the serial
//! port's clock divider.
