//! Two cores running one program, and a line that says they disagreed.
//!
//! A machine that must not be quietly wrong runs two of itself and
//! compares. What makes it worth something is that both copies see
//! exactly the same inputs in the same cycles, so that any difference
//! in what they do is theirs and not their inputs'; and that the
//! comparison covers everything a core says, not a sample of it.
//!
//! `Pair` holds two `Vreteno` harts. Every input the pair is given
//! goes to both: the wires directly, and the three channels through a
//! `Tee` each, which offers each word to both cores and takes the
//! next only once both have taken it. Every output is compared: the
//! three channels through a `Check` each, which takes a word from
//! both cores in one cycle, passes the first core's on and raises a
//! line when the two differ,
//! and the three wires through `Watch`, which compares them every
//! cycle.
//!
//! What leaves the pair is the first core's, so a design around it
//! sees one core. What it adds is `differs`, which goes high in the
//! cycle the two cores stop agreeing and stays high until `rst`.
//!
//! `fault` is for the self-test: while it is high the second core is
//! held in reset, which is a divergence with a known cause, and every
//! part of the comparison path is exercised by it.
