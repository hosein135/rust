// The Vreteno board on the Alinx AX7A200B: the pin and clock wrapper
// around the lowered design, and nothing else.
//
// Everything that computes is `board`, the netlist `#[lower]` writes for
// `vreteno32::board::Board`: the core, the router, the data memory, the
// timer, the serial port and the DDR3 memory with AMD's MIG controller
// in it. What a board needs and a lowered unit cannot say is here: the
// 200 MHz differential clock handed to the controller, which makes the
// design's clock from it, the resets, and the LEDs.
//
// The controller makes the clocks: it takes the board's 200 MHz, which
// is also its delay reference, runs the memory at 400 MHz, and hands
// back the 100 MHz the design runs on, with a reset that holds until
// that clock is good. The board has no clock generator of its own.
//
// The controller's reset is a pulse at power-on and nothing else. The
// core's reset follows the button, the controller's clock being good
// and its calibration, so the core starts only when the memory it may
// reach is ready, brought into the design's clock by two flip-flops.
//
// The LEDs are lit when driven low: the core halted, the serial line
// driven at least once, the memory calibrated, and a heartbeat.
//
// The second LED carries what the heartbeat used to, and the heartbeat
// moved to the fourth. The second now latches the first start bit on the
// serial line, which is the open question of issue #195: the board halts
// with every LED on and nothing arrives on the host's serial port, and
// nothing so far says whether a byte ever left the core.
//
// The fourth LED showed the clock generator's lock. A blinking heartbeat
// says that as well, since the counter behind it runs on the clock the
// controller makes, and a
// heartbeat in a new place is also how somebody at the board can tell
// that a new bitstream is in the part.

  // The button resets the core and not the memory. The controller's

  // reached the controller while a transaction was in flight stranded
  // the bus: the bridge in front of the controller waited on an
  // acknowledgement the reset controller never gave, nothing resets
  // that bridge, and every later access to the memory queued behind
  // it, so the loader took three words after a press and then nothing
  // (issue #333). With the memory running through the press, what was
  // in flight completes while the core is held, the core drains the
  // answers as it always does, and the bus is clean when it restarts.

  // this board's CP2102N, as Linux drives it, never reached the pin. It
  // gives the host a reset that no software on the core can miss,
  // because it is not software on the core, and it is what
  // `load --reset` uses (issue #332). The line is brought into the
  // design's clock through two flip-flops first. The reset is a pulse
  // when the count reaches the threshold rather than a level while the
  // line is low, so a line left floating low resets the core once and
  // not forever. The pulse is a millisecond, not a few cycles: a fetch
  // from the memory caught in flight answers long after a short pulse
  // has ended, and the core, back in the loader by then, would take
  // that answer as the reply to its first read of the serial port. A
