// The board with a JTAG master on its bus (issue 241): this file is
// `vreteno_board.v` with one addition, Vivado's JTAG-to-AXI master,
// `//cpu/vreteno:jtag_axi`, on the second host port of the lowered
// board, reached over the cable that programs the part. From the
// hardware manager, `create_hw_axi_txn` reads and writes every address
// the board's map names, whatever the core is doing: the data memory,
// the timer, the serial port, the interrupt controller, the DDR3, the
// boot memory. It tracks the other file line for line; the difference
// is the block at the end and the pins it drives.
//
//
// The Vreteno board on the Alinx AX7A200B: the pin and clock wrapper
// around the lowered design, and nothing else.
//
// Everything that computes is `board`, the netlist `#[lower]` writes for
// `vreteno32::board::Board`: the core, the router, the data memory, the
// timer, the serial port and the DDR3 memory with AMD's MIG controller
// in it. What a board needs and a lowered unit cannot say is here: the
// 200 MHz differential clock handed to the controller, which makes the
// design's clock from it, the resets, and the LEDs.
//
// The controller makes the clocks: it takes the board's 200 MHz, which
// is also its delay reference, runs the memory at 400 MHz, and hands
// back the 100 MHz the design runs on, with a reset that holds until
// that clock is good. The board has no clock generator of its own.
//
// The controller's reset is a pulse at power-on and nothing else. The
// core's reset follows the button, the controller's clock being good
// and its calibration, so the core starts only when the memory it may
// reach is ready, brought into the design's clock by two flip-flops.
//
// The LEDs are lit when driven low: the core halted, the serial line
// driven at least once, the memory calibrated, and a heartbeat.
//
// The second LED carries what the heartbeat used to, and the heartbeat
// moved to the fourth. The second now latches the first start bit on the
// serial line, which is the open question of issue #195: the board halts
// with every LED on and nothing arrives on the host's serial port, and
// nothing so far says whether a byte ever left the core.
//
// The fourth LED showed the clock generator's lock. A blinking heartbeat
// says that as well, since the counter behind it runs on the clock the
// controller makes, and a
// heartbeat in a new place is also how somebody at the board can tell
// that a new bitstream is in the part.

  // line is low, so a line left floating low resets the core once and
  // not forever. The pulse is a millisecond, not a few cycles: a fetch
  // from the memory caught in flight answers long after a short pulse
  // has ended, and the core, back in the loader by then, would take
