// The Vreteno board as it goes on the Alinx AX7A200B, simulated whole:
// the top with its resets, the lowered design with the DDR3 test in
// its memories, AMD's MIG controller, and two Micron models of
// the board's x16 chips on the memory's pins.
//
// The program writes words across the memory, reads them back, says
// `ddr3 ok` or `ddr3 bad` on the serial port and halts. The testbench
// reads the serial line as a terminal would, sixteen cycles of the
// 100 MHz clock a bit as the simulation netlist has it, and `ok` is the
// verdict the test's script reads: the core halted, and the last line
// it said was `ddr3 ok`.
