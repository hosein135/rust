//! A test of the board's entropy source, run by the core: the source
//! turned on, four words taken, and a line on the serial port that says
//! whether they came and differed. The core halts either way, after
//! the line.
//!
//! Then it reads the raw samples in a tight loop, windows of 32 that
//! overlap, and sends them joined as one run of samples in a row, under
//! `rawrun`, so a host can measure lags longer than a word (issue
//! 805). In simulation that run is the model's, which the board test
//! checks sample for sample.
//!
//! Built with `--cfg=board_run`, for the board, the program then
//! measures the source: it reads the raw samples, the folded bits
//! before the extractor, 4096 words of them, and sends each up the
//! serial line as eight hex digits, then 8192 samples in a row that
//! the peripheral captured, as 256 words under `rawcap`, a heading of
//! its own so that it is never read as part of the joined run (issue
//! 835), then 4096 words of the extractor's output the same way.
//! That is what a host estimates the source's bias and entropy from,
//! and the only evidence there is that the rings are random rather
//! than merely running (issue 458). A simulation runs the model rings
//! and says nothing here, since what it would measure is the model.
