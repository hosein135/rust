//! An icosahedron, worked out by the core and filled by Razboj, the GPU.
//!
//! This is the software half of a display list. The core holds the
//! solid as twelve vertices and twenty triangles, turns it to face the
//! camera, works out which faces point at the camera and how brightly
//! each catches the light, and writes what is left into memory as the
//! words the rasteriser reads. It never touches a pixel: the
//! rasteriser finds the list where the program left it and fills
//! every triangle in it.
//!
//! The solid is convex, and that is why there is no sort. Of a convex
//! solid, the faces that point at the camera never cover one another,
//! so the order they are drawn in does not matter and the rasteriser
//! needs no depth buffer and the program no painter's algorithm.
//!
//! What the machine does not give you shapes the file, as it does in
//! `hello.rs`. There is no operating system, no standard library and
//! no floating point, so the geometry is integer throughout: the view
//! is a rotation matrix in eight fractional bits, worked out once
//! here rather than from a sine table on the core, and the
//! perspective is one division per coordinate.
//!
//! Nothing here indexes a slice and nothing divides without saying
//! what happens when it cannot, and that is not a style. Either would
//! ask for a check that can fail, a check that can fail calls
//! `core`'s panic path, and that path drags in `core::fmt`, which is
//! larger than the four kilobytes of instruction memory. `elf2vreteno`
//! refuses such an image and says so, which is how this was found.
//!
//! The addresses below are the agreement with the rest of the system:
//! `soc::DL_BASE` and `soc::DL_CTRL` are the same numbers, and the
//! word layout is the one `razboj::dl` states. The count goes in last,
//! because writing it is what tells the rasteriser the list is ready.
