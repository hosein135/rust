"""Building a program for Vreteno from a build for this machine.

A program for the core is compiled for another machine than the one
the build runs on, so the target that produces it has to be built
under another platform. A transition does that: `vreteno_image` takes
a `rust_binary`, builds it for the core, runs `//tools/elf2vreteno`
over the ELF, and gives back the Rust source of the image. Everything
else in the tree then depends on that source and nothing has to be
built by hand with a flag.

# The flags every crate built for the core is compiled with, the
# programs' own and every library they link alike: the HAL's, which
# the programs' `VRETENO_FLAGS` repeat. A library that set none was
# built for the core unoptimised, with its debug assertions and
# overflow checks, which cost the logo's table a copy of ten kilobytes
# a pixel (issue 1245). The transition sets them once for all of them
# (issue 1248), and a build for this machine, the libraries' own tests
# included, keeps its defaults.
