//! The Ethernet PHY's management registers, read by the core over
//! MDIO (issue 864), printed on the serial port, and nothing written.
//!
//! * `phy at` and the first address, of the 32 MDIO allows, whose
//!   register 2 reads other than `ffff`. A line nobody drives reads
//!   all ones through its pull-up, so `ffff` is no PHY there. `no phy`
//!   if none answers.
//! * Eight lines, `r00` to `r28`, each the register named and the three
//!   after it, as four hexadecimal digits each. Registers 0 to 15 are
//!   the ones IEEE 802.3 clause 22 defines: 2 and 3 are the PHY's
//!   identifier. Registers 16 to 31 are the vendor's, as page 0 has
//!   them; register 31 selects the page, and this program leaves it
//!   alone. JLSemi's Linux driver puts the receive delay on page 3336,
//!   which a dump of page 0 cannot show (#864).
//!
//! The program only reads. It never writes a register, not even a
//! page select, so it leaves the PHY as it found it. A read of
//! register 1 does clear its latched link-down bit, as clause 22
//! defines, which the PHY sets again if the link drops.
//!
//! MDC is 1.25 MHz from the board's 100 MHz, half the 2.5 MHz that
//! 802.3 allows, since the JL2121's own limit is not known.
