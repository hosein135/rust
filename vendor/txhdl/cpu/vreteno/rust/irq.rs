//! Input by interrupt, for Vreteno on the board: the serial port's
//! receive interrupt goes through the platform-level interrupt
//! controller to the core, and the program takes one interrupt per
//! byte instead of polling for input.
//!
//! The program says `ready`, which the terminal answers by typing four
//! bytes, and then waits in a loop that never touches the serial port.
//! Each byte that lands in the port's buffer raises its interrupt line,
//! which is the controller's source 1; the controller raises the core's
//! external interrupt, and the core traps to the crate's entry, which
//! calls the handler registered for that line. The handler claims the
//! source, reads one byte, and completes the source. A byte left in
//! the buffer keeps the port's line high, so the controller asks again
//! on the complete, and the next byte is the next interrupt. Once four
//! bytes have come in, the program says what they were and how many
//! interrupts brought them, and stops.
//!
//! The trap vector and the saving and restoring of registers, which
//! this file once did by hand, are the crate's now (issue 142). The
//! core's pending bit for the external interrupt is the controller's
//! line, so nothing clears it (#788).
