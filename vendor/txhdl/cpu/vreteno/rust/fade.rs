//! A program that breathes an LED, to show the pulse width modulator
//! working on the board.
//!
//! The modulator shares the serial port's page: the port at `0x3000`
//! and the modulator at `0x3100`. Channel 0 drives the board's first
//! LED through the top level, and the program walks its duty up to the
//! period and back down, holding each step for a moment, so the light
//! rises and falls rather than stepping.
//!
//! The period is 10 000 cycles of the 100 MHz clock, which switches the
//! pin at 10 kHz: far above what an eye follows, so what is seen is the
//! average rather than a flicker. A step is held for about 4 ms, and
//! the walk up and back down takes about two seconds.
//!
//! The serial port says what the program is doing, once at the start
//! and then a dot per sweep, so a reader with no view of the board can
//! tell it is running. As in `hello.rs`, nothing here indexes a slice
//! and nothing divides, so nothing asks for `core`'s panic path.
