//! Two frames sent by the Ethernet port back to back, written into
//! memory by the core and fetched onto the wire by the port's engines,
//! as the Zephyr driver sends them.
//!
//! The core writes the frame into a transmit slot in DDR3, tells the
//! port which slot and how many bytes, and asks it to go. From there
//! the core touches nothing: the fetch engine reads the frame's words
//! back out of memory, `FrameOut` turns them into bytes, and the
//! sharing unit puts them on the wire. The test reads what left the
//! port and compares it with what the core wrote.
//!
//! One step here is the driver's obligation rather than the port's,
//! and it is in the program because a driver that left it out would be
//! wrong. Stores on this machine are posted, so before asking the port
//! to go, the program reads the frame's last word back. The link
//! answers a load behind an unanswered store to the same address with
//! the stored value, so once that read returns, the frame is in memory
//! for the engine to fetch. A `fence` would do the same since issue
//! 432 was fixed; the read-back is what was proven on the board and
//! stays.
//!
//! As in `hello.rs`, nothing here indexes a slice and nothing divides,
//! so nothing asks for `core`'s panic path.
