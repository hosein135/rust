//! The turning icosahedron through the GL ES library (issue 995): the
//! frames `ico_list.rs` writes by hand, written instead with
//! `glFrustumx`, `glRotatex`, `glLightxv` and `glDrawElements` from
//! `//gles`.
//!
//! This file has no hardware in it, as `ico_list.rs` has none, so the
//! board's program takes either, and a test on the host draws both
//! through Razboj's model and holds the two pictures to each other
//! (`docs/gles.md` section 8).
//!
//! ## The same picture
//!
//! * **The solid.** Faceted: every face its own three corners, all
//!   carrying the face's normal, sixty vertices drawn by
//!   `glDrawElements` with `GL_TRIANGLES`. The faces and their normals
//!   are `ico_list`'s, worked out the same way.
//! * **The view.** `ico_list` puts a point at `D - z` from the eye and
//!   scales by `PROJ` pixels. That is `glTranslatex` by `-D` and a
//!   frustum whose near plane is one unit away and `W / PROJ` units
//!   wide. The turn is `glRotatex` about the x axis after the y axis,
//!   a full turn being 256 of `ico_list`'s steps.
//! * **The light.** `ico_list` lights a face by how directly it faces
//!   the eye, `l`, as the square root of `0.4 + 0.6 l`, which spaces the
//!   shades evenly to the eye. GL's sum has no square root, but one
//!   directional light at the eye has its half vector at the eye too, so
//!   the specular term is `l` to the shininess. With the scene's ambient
//!   at the colour's full `sqrt(0.4)`, no diffuse, and the rest of the
//!   colour as specular at a shininess of 0.8715, GL's sum stays within
//!   0.004 of the square root over every `l`, under one step of a
//!   channel.
//! * **Hidden faces.** `glCullFace`, the back faces, as `ico_list` drops
//!   a face wound the wrong way on the screen; or, with `depth`, the
//!   depth test instead (#1273), every face drawn and each pixel the
//!   nearest face's, which for a convex solid is the same picture. A
//!   list that tests depth is a tile table's to draw. Flat shading.
//!
//! ## Two frames in one framebuffer
//!
//! GL's window has its rows upwards and Razboj's downwards, and the
//! library turns them over against the screen's height. So the second
//! frame, rows 512 to 991 of the framebuffer, is a screen of 992 rows
//! with a viewport of the lower 480 of GL's: those are Razboj's rows
//! 512 to 991. The backdrop's rectangle at the head of the list is
//! `ico_list`'s own, since a GL clear is the whole screen and would
//! take the other frame and the logo with it.
