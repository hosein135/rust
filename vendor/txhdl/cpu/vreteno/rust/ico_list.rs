//! The turning icosahedron as Razboj's display lists (issue 986): the
//! geometry `ico_hdmi.rs` worked out to draw on the core, now written as
//! one list a frame for the rasteriser to fill.
//!
//! This file is the part with no hardware in it, so that the program
//! includes it and a test on the host renders the same lists through
//! Razboj's model. It needs no standard library and allocates nothing.
//!
//! ## Two frames in one framebuffer
//!
//! The rasteriser's framebuffer is a constant of its type: rows of 1024
//! words from `0x4200_0000`, and the scanout shows 640 by 480 of it.
//! So the second frame is not a second base. It is rows 512 to 991 of
//! the same framebuffer, at `0x4220_0000`: every row of a frame drawn
//! there is 512 more, and the scanout's base moves between the two.
//!
//! ## What a frame's list holds
//!
//! First a rectangle of the backdrop over the box the solid filled the
//! last time this frame was drawn, which is all of it that can have
//! changed. Then a triangle a face, for every face that faces the
//! camera. The solid is convex, so those faces never overlap and their
//! order does not matter. The rasteriser fills a pixel when its centre
//! is inside, with ties to the top and left edges, so two faces that
//! share an edge fill each pixel of it once.

/// The screen, and the rows from one frame to the other.
