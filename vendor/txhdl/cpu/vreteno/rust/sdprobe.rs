//! The card in the SD slot, brought up by the core and read (issue
//! 153), printed on the serial port, and nothing written.
//!
//! * `cmd8` and what the card echoed of `0x1aa`: a card of version 2
//!   or later echoes it whole, and only such a card can be high
//!   capacity. `no card` if nothing answers `CMD0` and `CMD8`.
//! * `ocr` and the operating conditions the card answered `ACMD41`
//!   with, once it said it was ready, then `sdhc` or `sdsc` from the
//!   capacity bit. The program asks with HCS set, as a host that can
//!   address a card above 2 GB by block must.
//! * `cid` and the card's identity, four words, the manufacturer
//!   first; `rca` and the address the card took for itself.
//! * `blk0`, then block 0 read on one data line, sixteen bytes to a
//!   line, then `wide same` or `wide differs` for the same block read
//!   again on four lines, which is what shows all four lines carry
//!   what the card sends.
//! * `boot 55aa` if the block ends with the boot signature a
//!   partition table carries, `boot none` if not.
//! * `dma same` if blocks 0 to 3, read with one `CMD18` straight into
//!   the DDR3 by the host's store engine while the card sends them back
//!   to back, match the same blocks read one at a time through the
//!   buffer; `dma differs` and the block's number if one does not
//!   (issue 912).
//!
//! The card is identified at 400 kHz, as the specification asks of a
//! card not yet known, and read at 25 MHz, the default speed's top: the
//! host samples a card's lines a cycle after the rise, from registers in
//! the pads, which gives a card 30 ns to answer in (issue 929). Block 0
//! is address 0 on a card of either capacity, so the read needs no case
//! for either.
//!
//! The program only reads. It sends no write command, so the card
//! holds afterwards exactly what it held before.
