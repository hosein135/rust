//! A loader that lives in the boot memory and takes a program off the
//! serial port.
//!
//! Until the core could fetch from the bus, a program lived in the
//! netlist and changing it meant a place and route. The core fetches
//! from the bus above the boot memory now, so a program can be written
//! into the board's DDR3 and jumped to, and the loop becomes: build an
//! image, send it down the wire, watch it run.
//!
//! ## The stream
//!
//! Deliberately dumb, as issue 135 asks. Every number is four bytes,
//! least significant first, which is how the core reads memory anyway.
//!
//! | Field | What it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | magic | `TXLD`, so noise on the line is not mistaken for a load |
//! | address | where the bytes go, and where the loader jumps |
//! | length | how many bytes follow, a multiple of four |
//! | bytes | the program, length of them |
//! | checksum | the sum of the words above, wrapping |
//!
//! The loader types `K` when it has taken the header and after every
//! block of `BLOCK_WORDS` words, and the sender waits for it. Without
//! that the sender has to know how fast the loader writes: the port
//! buffers eight bytes, a write into memory takes longer than a byte
//! takes to arrive at any rate worth using, and the difference is a
//! stream that is silently short. One byte per block costs nothing and
//! removes the question.
//!
//! The address is in the stream rather than assumed, because assuming
//! it is the kind of decision that is cheap now and awkward later.
//!
//! ## What it says
//!
//! Every step says something on the serial port, so a load that failed
//! is never confused with a program that loaded and then crashed:
//! `boot` when it is waiting, `load` when a header arrived, `ok` before
//! it jumps, and `bad len` or `bad sum` when it will not. A stream
//! without the magic word is never refused: the loader reads on until
//! it finds one.
//! After a refusal it waits for another stream rather than stopping,
//! since the usual cause is a half-typed command on the other end.
//! Two more words tell a loaded program that came back from a reset,
//! which read the same on the line otherwise (issue 413). A trap taken
//! before the program set `mtvec` lands at address zero, where the
//! loader starts over; that pass says `trap`, the cause and the
//! address first, since a trap fills `mcause` and a start from
//! configuration finds it clear. On the board, a one-word `ebreak`
//! image says `trap 00000003 at 40000000`, and a one-word `ret` says
//! `trap 00000002 at` the word after the loader's jump: `entry` never
//! returns as far as the compiler knows, so nothing runnable follows
//! the jump, and a program that returns reads as that illegal word
//! rather than as the loop going round. Every pass of the loop after
//! the first therefore says `boot again` only after a refusal, and a
//! reset, which starts the loop from nothing, cannot say it.
//!
//! As in `hello.rs`, nothing here indexes a slice and nothing divides,
//! so nothing asks for `core`'s panic path.
