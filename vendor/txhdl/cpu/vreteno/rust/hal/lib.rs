//! What every program for Vreteno would otherwise write again.
//!
//! A program for this core used to start from a linker script, a
//! naked `_start` that set the stack and zeroed `.bss`, and raw
//! volatile writes at addresses copied from the board's map into each
//! program. That is the right amount of machinery for a greeting and
//! the wrong place to start the fourth program from. This crate holds
//! the machinery once:
//!
//! * [`map`], the address map of the board and the simulation, in one
//!   place;
//! * the peripherals as types with methods, [`Uart`], [`Timer`],
//!   [`Plic`], [`Pwm`], [`Video`] and [`Scan`], each a set of volatile accesses
//!   at the map's addresses and nothing else;
//! * [`csr`], the control and status registers the core has;
//! * [`trap`], an entry that saves a frame, reads `mcause`, and
//!   dispatches an exception or an interrupt to a handler the program
//!   registered;
//! * [`entry!`], which owns the reset path, and [`halt`], which is how
//!   a program says it is done.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates, formats or unwinds: the crate is `no_std`,
//! the panic handler halts the core, and a program that links this
//! defines no panic handler of its own.
//!
//! The crate is inline RISC-V assembly from end to end and builds only
//! for the core, through the transition a program's image applies.
