//! The trap entry and the dispatcher.
//!
//! The core traps to `mtvec` with the cause in `mcause` and the
//! interrupted instruction in `mepc`. [`install`] points `mtvec` at
//! [`entry`], which saves every register a call may change and `mepc`
//! into a [`Frame`] on the stack, hands the frame to [`dispatch`], and
//! on the way back restores the registers and `mepc` from the frame
//! and returns with `mret`. So a handler is an ordinary Rust function
//! that takes the frame, and one that wants to resume after a
//! faulting or calling instruction moves `frame.mepc` on.
//!
//! An interrupt goes to the handler registered for its line with
//! [`on_interrupt`]; an exception to the one registered for its cause
//! with [`on_exception`]. An interrupt nobody registered for is taken
//! and ignored; an exception nobody registered for halts the core,
//! since a program that traps where it did not expect to has nothing
//! sensible to resume.
//!
//! The core's pending bit for the external interrupt is the
//! controller's line, as the privileged specification has it, so the
//! dispatcher clears nothing: the handler's claim lowers the line, and
//! a request still waiting keeps it up (#788).
