//! A test of the board's DDR3 memory, run by the core: words written
//! across the gigabyte of the memory's region and read back,
//! and a line on the serial port that says whether every one came back.
//! The core halts when every word came back and spins when one did not,
//! so the board's first LED, which shows the halt, is the same verdict
//! for anybody who cannot read the serial port.
//!
//! Built with `--cfg=board_run`, for the board, the program also says a
//! header line before it touches the memory and a dot every ten seconds
//! before and after the test, so that a reader who attaches at any
//! moment can tell a silent serial path from a core that never ran.
//!
//! The words go at addresses a sixteenth of the region apart, each at a
//! different offset into its sixteenth, so a mistake in the high address
//! bits and a mistake in the low ones both show. Each word is its own
//! address mixed with a constant, so no two are alike and a word read
//! from the wrong place is a wrong word. The whole of the pattern is
//! written before any of it is read, so a write that lands on another
//! word's address shows too.
//!
//! As in `hello.rs`, nothing here indexes a slice and nothing divides,
//! so nothing asks for `core`'s panic path.
