//! A frame received by the Ethernet port, read back out of memory by
//! the core, as the Zephyr driver reads one.
//!
//! The frame comes in on the wire and the port's engines store it in
//! DDR3 without the core touching a byte of it (issue 151). This
//! program waits for the port to say a frame has arrived, reads its
//! length and slot from the port's registers, and then reads the frame
//! itself out of the slot in DDR3, through the same bus and the same
//! bridge the engines wrote it through. It says what it read on the
//! serial port and acknowledges the frame.
//!
//! So a run that says the right bytes has shown the whole receive
//! path, end to end: the wire, the split by EtherType, the length
//! found again after the crossing, the bytes packed into words, the
//! store engine's bursts, the arbiter, the router and the bridge into
//! the memory, and the register block's arrival. None of it is taken
//! on trust, because the bytes the core reads are the only evidence
//! offered, and they come out of the real memory.
//!
//! As in `hello.rs`, nothing here indexes a slice and nothing divides,
//! so nothing asks for `core`'s panic path.
