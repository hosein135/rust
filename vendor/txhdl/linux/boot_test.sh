# Linux on the machine model, to its shell (issue 1016, M9 of #279).
#
# Boots the image //linux:model_boot packs, the tree's own OpenSBI,
# kernel and initramfs with mem=64M, on //cpu/vreteno:machine, and
# passes when the console shows /init's marker and BusyBox's prompt.
# About 200 million instructions, a few minutes at the model's speed,
# so it is manual and the nightly linux workflow runs it.
#
# Arguments past the image go to the machine: boot_loaded_test passes
# --as-loaded, the serial port as the loader leaves it on the board,
# with a request the interrupt controller holds (issue 1136).
