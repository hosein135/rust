//! EGL's machine on the board (issue 996): what a swap does to
//! Vreteno's peripherals, behind `gles_egl::Machine`.
//!
//! * The display list is Razboj's, in the DDR3 at `0x4280_0000`, and GL
//!   writes each frame straight into it. The core has no data cache, so
//!   the stores reach the memory in order; the last word is read back
//!   before the doorbell is rung, so that the posted stores have landed
//!   when Razboj reads the list, as `ico_hdmi.rs` does.
//! * The doorbell at `0x3900` takes the count, and reads zero again with
//!   the rasteriser's status idle once every pixel is written.
//! * A frame that tests depth is binned into a megabyte two into the
//!   list's four, then laid out at the list as a tile table, its records
//!   first and its entries `razboj_tile::ENTRIES_AT` past them, and rung
//!   with the count's bit 31 set (#1273).
//! * The scanout's base, at `0x3280`, is the byte the buffer starts at,
//!   `0x4200_0000` and 4096 bytes a row; the first swap also sets the bit
//!   that shows the scanout.
//! * The vertical blanking is bit 0 of the video peripheral's status, at
//!   `0x3200`.
//!
//! The addresses are the HAL's `map` (`cpu/vreteno/rust/hal/lib.rs`),
//! stated here rather than taken from it, since the HAL brings a panic
//! handler of its own and a Zephyr program has another. Nothing here is
//! `#[no_mangle]`, so a program in the boot memory can use the machine
//! without EGL's entry points; `zephyr.rs` installs it for EGL.
