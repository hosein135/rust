//! (#989), written again here without the standard library, with the

//!
//! The planes fit in 64 bits for vertices in Razboj's range

//! 2^15 sixteenths, a channel's difference under 2^8, so a gradient's
//! numerator is under 2^24, its products with an offset inside the box
//! under 2^39, their sum under 2^40, and that times 2^16 under 2^56;
//! twice the area is under 2^31.
