# The flagship's Ethernet and HDMI pins, timed (issue 861). Without this,
# check_timing counted five inputs with no input delay and 38 outputs
# with no output delay, and timing was met only because those paths were
# not timed at all. The board's other pins are timed or false-pathed by
# cpu/vreteno/board/ax7a200_io.xdc (#847).

# RGMII, to the JL2121 PHY, at gigabit: 125 MHz, a nibble on each edge.
#
# The JL2121's own data sheet could not be found on 2026-10-02, so the
# figures below are RGMII 2.0's and are placeholders, to be confirmed
# against the JL2121's sheet. The board's traces are short and were not
# measured; 100 ps of mismatch is allowed for in each.

# Receive. The PHY's clock reaches the pins centred in its data: RGMII
# 2.0 with the delay in the source, data valid TsetupT = 1.2 ns before
# and TholdT = 1.2 ns after each edge, less the 100 ps, so 1.1 ns.
#
# That is not what #231 concluded, and the board's own record is why.
# The design that received nothing clocked the IDDRs through a plain
# BUFG, about 3.4 ns late, which samples where a centred source changes
# too, so it never showed that the PHY adds no delay. Every point of the
# sweep that followed fits a centred source: through the MMCM, whose
# compensation removes the insertion delay, shifts of 45 to 112.5
# degrees received and 180 did not. Against RGMII's edge-aligned figures
# instead, data within 500 ps of the edge, the shift that passes is
# 170 degrees, where the board received nothing.
#
# Each nibble is stated against the edge it is centred on: it begins
# between 2.9 and 1.1 ns before that edge. eth_rgmii shifts the clock
# in an MMCM by RX_CLOCK_PHASE, set in flagship.v, and the IDDRs take
# each nibble on the shifted copy of its edge, with the nibble before it
# on the edge before. With Vivado's routed delays, setup slack is
# phase - 1.58 ns and hold slack 1.96 ns - phase, so 90 degrees, 2 ns,
# misses hold by 40 ps and 78.75 degrees, 1.75 ns, meets both.

# The pixel, the syncs and the enable leave on the pixel clock's rise,

# an ODDR. The encoder latches on the edge its EDGE bit chooses. The
# figures are the SiI9134 data sheet's (SiI-DS-0193-D, single-edge
# clocking): setup 1.0 ns and hold 0.5 ns to IDCK rising, EDGE = 1;
# setup 1.0 ns and hold 0.8 ns to IDCK falling, EDGE = 0. The design
# writes 0x35 to the system control register, 0x08, and no document in
# the tree states which bit of it is EDGE, so both edges are checked
# here: whichever the chip uses, its window is met.
