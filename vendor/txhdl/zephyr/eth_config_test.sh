# leaves the driver uncompiled and every fault in it unfound. This
# checks the build that has one.

# That distinction is the whole reason this file exists.
# `uart_vreteno.c` was written, committed, and checked by a test that
# reads it as text, and no compiler saw it for as long as the module
# was absent from the build; it kept an implicit declaration of
# `sys_read32` the entire time. A driver in the tree is not a driver
# that builds.
