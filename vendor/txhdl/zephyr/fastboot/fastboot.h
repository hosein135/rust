/*
 * Fastboot over TCP, as a device speaks it, with no transport in it.
 *
 * The protocol is AOSP's, from `fastboot/README.md`: the host opens a
 * TCP connection to the device on port 5554, both sides send `FB01`,
 * and from then on every message in either direction is an eight byte
 * big-endian length followed by that many bytes. A command is ASCII of
 * at most 4096 bytes; an answer is `OKAY`, `FAIL`, `DATA` or `INFO`
 * and a message (issue 143).
 *
 * This file knows nothing of sockets. Bytes come in through
 * `fb_input`, in whatever pieces the transport happens to deliver,
 * and answers go out through `fb_ops.send`. The same code is what the
 * Zephyr server runs on the board and what the host harness runs
 * against stock `fastboot`, so the test that the tool and this code
 * agree is a test of the code the board runs.
 *
 * What it does: `getvar`, `download` and `boot`, which is what
 * `fastboot boot <image>` needs, and `reboot` where the platform can
 * reset. It refuses `flash`, `erase` and anything else with `FAIL`,
 * since nothing on this machine writes persistent storage.
