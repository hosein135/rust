"""Building a Zephyr image with this repository's own toolchain.

Zephyr's build is CMake, Kconfig and its own Python, and none of that
becomes Bazel here. What Bazel does is hand that build every tool it
needs, pinned by checksum, and take the image out the other end, so
that the port under `//zephyr` is compiled by `bazel test //...`
rather than by a reader following a README (issue 390).

The flag that matters is `-DZEPHYR_MODULES`. Zephyr's own
documentation says `ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES`, and that does nothing
here: Zephyr collects it and hands it to a script it runs only
`if(WEST OR ZEPHYR_MODULES)`. A hermetic build has no `west` by
construction, so a rule written from the documented flag would fetch
Zephyr, build an ELF, pass, and be testing a Zephyr with none of this
repository in it.

# The Python packages Zephyr's build imports come from the `zephyr_py`
# hub, which `pip.parse` makes for Python 3.12 only, and the hub picks
# a package by rules_python's version setting. That setting is 3.12
# because this module makes 3.12 the default, which only the root
# module may: from a workspace that depends on TxHDL the default is the
# root's, the hub matches nothing, and analysis fails (issue 1001). So
# the packages are taken at 3.12 here, whoever the root is, the same
