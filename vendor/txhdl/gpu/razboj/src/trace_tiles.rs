//! The traced run of a list drawn in tiles (issue 1255): a scene on a
//! screen two tiles across and one down, binned into a
//! tile table and drawn through the tile buffer, then written out a row
//! at a time. It writes the trace and the rasteriser's netlist, so the
//! build replays the netlist under nvc and Verilator against this run,
//! the tile buffer and its write-out included, and it checks the picture
//! against the model.
