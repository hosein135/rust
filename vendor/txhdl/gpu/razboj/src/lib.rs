//! Razboj, a minimal GPU in TxHDL: a rasteriser that reads a display
//! list and writes pixels into memory over AXI.
//!
//! - [`op`]: what a display list entry says.
//! - [`raster`]: the rasteriser, a unit and an AXI host.
//! - [`fb`]: the framebuffer, a unit and an AXI peripheral.
//! - [`model`]: the same rasteriser written with loops, which the
//!   hardware is checked against.
//! - [`tiles`]: a display list binned into tiles, with the check that
//!   it draws what the list draws.
//! - [`image`]: the framebuffer as a PNG file and as colour on a
//!   terminal.
