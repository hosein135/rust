//! It answers write bursts and read bursts of any length: the
//! rasteriser writes a run of a row's pixels as one burst (issue 987)
//! and fetches a display list entry as one. A read's first beat is
//! answered from the memory in the cycle the request is taken and the
//! rest follow a beat a cycle; a write is held while its beats arrive,
//! because AXI4 puts no identifier on the write data channel and the
//! beats therefore come when they come, and it is answered once, with
//! its last. A beat writes only the bytes its strobes name, so a beat
//! with none writes nothing. The word address is the byte address
//! shifted by two and masked to the memory, so a stray address wraps
//! instead of ending the run.
