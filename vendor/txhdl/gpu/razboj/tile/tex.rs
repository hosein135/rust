//! Textures (issue 997): what a program and Razboj agree on, with no
//! standard library, so that the GL library on Vreteno lays textures out
//! with the same code the tests check.
//!
//! A texture is its levels in DDR3, each RGBA in 32 bits a texel,
//! `0xAARRGGBB` as a pixel is, and stored in blocks of 4 by 4 texels, 64
//! bytes, so that the texels a cache line holds are one burst. A
//! texture's descriptor, [`Desc`], is sixteen words in a table the
//! program keeps, and an entry names its texture by its index there.
//!
//! A textured entry carries three planes for the walk to step, as a
//! colour channel's: `u q` and `v q`, the texel coordinates of the base
//! level times `q`, with 32 bits of fraction, and `q`, the reciprocal of
//! the clip w scaled so that its largest at a vertex is one, with 48. All
//! three are affine in the window, so a pixel's `u` is `(u q) / q` there,
//! which is perspective-correct. The planes are 64 bits, so they take two
//! slots of their own after the entry's second slot:
//!
//! ```text
//!   slot A  words 0-5   u q: value, step right, step down, low word first
//!           words 6-11  v q: the same
//!           word 12     k, the shift of the numerators below
//!           word 13     the descriptor's index
//!           word 14     [2:0] the environment
//!           word 15     the environment's colour
//!   slot B  words 0-5   q: value, step right, step down, low word first
//!           words 6-13  the numerators of ∂u/∂x, ∂v/∂x, ∂u/∂y and ∂v/∂y,
//!                       each a value and a step, down for the first two
//!                       and right for the others, shifted right by k
//! ```
//!
//! The level of detail is GL's `ρ = max(|∂u/∂x|, |∂u/∂y|, |∂v/∂x|,
//! |∂v/∂y|)`, one of the scale factors GL ES allows. With `U = u q`,
//! `∂u/∂x = (U_x q - U q_x) / q²`, whose numerator varies only down the
//! box, and `∂u/∂y`'s only across it, so each is two words.
