//! Razboj's display list in tiles, for the CPU: the tile table's format,
//! and the binning that sorts a list's entries into the tiles they
//! touch (`docs/razboj-tiles.md`, issue 1157).
//!
//! This crate has no standard library and allocates nothing, so a
//! Vreteno program can bin its own lists with the same code the tests
//! check against the model. It works on instructions as the words of
//! `razboj::dl`'s format, after the assembler has clipped, wound and
//! shaded them, and it writes words in the same format back.
//!
//! A tile is 64 by 64 pixels, its origin at multiples of 64. A tile is
//! a scissor box, so binning an entry is clipping its box to each tile
//! it touches, with [`clip`], the clip the assembler's scissor box
//! uses (issue 990), and writing one entry per tile. The edges need
//! nothing more, since the rasteriser tests them against the same
//! vertices whatever the box. A shaded triangle's planes start at its
//! box's first pixel, so a clipped entry's start is the whole entry's
//! stepped to the clipped box's first pixel, in the wrapping
//! thirty-two bit arithmetic of the rasteriser's own adders: then each
//! pixel's colour is the one the untiled entry gives it, to the bit.
//! Working each tile's planes out afresh would round at a different
//! place and could differ in the last bit.
