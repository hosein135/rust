//! The bandwidth of the path into DDR3, measured in simulation: what
//! issue 1023 asked of the path, before and after it was widened.
//!
//! Every user of the board's DDR3 reaches it through one path: the link
//! into `Ddr3Per`, its `AxiPerPins`, and the controller's own AXI4 port.
//! Nothing on the path holds a burst back: the pins part holds nothing,
//! and the controller takes several bursts at once and streams each
//! one's beats. So a read costs the controller's latency once a burst,
//! not once a word, and with a few bursts in flight even that overlaps,
//! which leaves a word a cycle. A write takes a beat a cycle too, with
//! no step between bursts (issue 1121) while the client has room to
//! issue the next before it waits on an old one.
//!
//! [`pins`] measures that path with the controller replaced by a memory
//! on its pins that answers after a given latency, so the cost per word
//! can be read off against the latency. [`ddr3_per`] measures the
//! peripheral itself, whose controller model answers after the
//! controller's latency as the vendor's simulation measured it. The
//! board run of issue 1023 measures the controller itself.
