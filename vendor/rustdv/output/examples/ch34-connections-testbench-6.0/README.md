# Chapter 34: Connections — Testbench 6.0 — figure map

Run with:

```
sim-common/run_sim.sh ch34_connections_testbench_6_0 tinyalu \
    sim-common/hdl/timescale.v sim-common/hdl/tinyalu.sv
```

**This crate carries two chapters (D91).** Chapter 33 defines the six
components and has nothing to run; Chapter 34 wires them up and runs. The
captions in the source carry the chapter number, so both live here without
colliding. Chapter 33's figure map is in
[`../ch33-components-testbench-6.0/README.md`](../ch33-components-testbench-6.0/README.md).

Figure numbers are the **book's** (D110: one numbering space per chapter, code
and transcripts drawn from the same sequence); the `.rs` captions carry the same
numbers. Figure 1 is the book's SVG architecture drawing, which is why the
crate's first Chapter 34 caption is Figure 2.

| Figure | Title | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The 6.0 architecture | book SVG drawing — no code |
| 2 | Build the components and the FIFOs; connect in one place | `src/ch34_connections_testbench_6_0.rs` (`AluEnv`) |
| 3 | The test is just the env | `src/ch34_connections_testbench_6_0.rs` (`AluTest`) |
| 4 | Testbench 6.0 running | transcript — `AluTest` |

One test, ending `REGRESSION: PASS`. The transcript below is the whole
testbench — Chapter 33's components included — since they only run once
Chapter 34 has connected them.

## Architecture

```
  Tester --put--> [cmd_fifo] --get--> Driver --> BFM --> DUT

  CmdMonitor --pub--> [cmd_bus] --sub--> Scoreboard
                           \----sub----> Coverage

  ResultMonitor --pub--> [result_bus] --sub--> Scoreboard
```

Every connection is the same shape — a concrete FIFO, a named export,
`connect(component, PORT_NAME)` — whether the traffic is point-to-point
(`TlmFifo`) or broadcast (`AnalysisBus`).

## The Rust win worth noting

The Scoreboard needs **two** analysis streams. SystemVerilog cannot give one
class two `write` methods, so it needs the `uvm_analysis_imp_decl` macros;
pyuvm cannot express it at all with one `write` per class. Here each stream gets
its own `SubscribePort` and its own sink struct — and it works the same way when
both streams carry the same type, which is the case the SV macros exist for
(D20/D88).

## Why the Tester waits before dropping its objection

`put` returns when the FIFO accepts a command, not when the DUT has answered it.
Dropping the objection at that point ends the run phase with commands still in
the pipeline, and the scoreboard checks fewer results than it saw commands — it
does not fail, it silently checks less. The Python testbench waits ten clocks
after its last put; this one waits twenty, because the multiply is the last
operation and takes the longest to come back.

This chapter is what caught D82c: before it, the objection race dropped the whole
run tree, taking the components with it, and `check` never ran at all.
