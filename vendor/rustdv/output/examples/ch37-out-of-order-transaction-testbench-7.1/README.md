# Chapter 37: Out-of-Order Transactions: Testbench 7.1 — figure map

Run with:

```
sim-common/run_sim.sh ch37_out_of_order_transaction_testbench_7_1 playground
```

Figure numbers are the **book's** (D110: one numbering space per chapter, code
and transcripts drawn from the same sequence); the `.rs` captions carry the same
numbers. The hanging-`get_response` passage is prose in the book, not a numbered
figure, and the crate's comment for it carries no number.

| Figure | Title | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A request that says how long it takes, and its answer | `src/ch37_out_of_order_transaction_testbench_7_1.rs` (`Req`, `Rsp`) |
| 2 | A driver that accepts work and answers it later | `src/ch37_out_of_order_transaction_testbench_7_1.rs` (`Driver`, `InFlight`) |
| 3 | Send four requests, then collect four answers | `src/ch37_out_of_order_transaction_testbench_7_1.rs` (`Seq`) |
| 4 | A sequencer and a driver, and the test that runs them | `src/ch37_out_of_order_transaction_testbench_7_1.rs` (`Env`, `ResponseTest`) |
| 5 | Answers arrive in the reverse of the order asked | transcript — `ResponseTest` |

One test, ending `REGRESSION: PASS`.

## Transcript

**Figure 5.** Verbatim from `sim-common/run_sim.sh
ch37_out_of_order_transaction_testbench_7_1 playground`, `RUSTDV_RANDOM_SEED=1`.

The chapter's whole argument in one log. `sent` runs `#1, #2, #3, #4` with
descending delays; `answering` and `got` both run `#4, #3, #2, #1` — the exact
reverse — and every answer still carries back its own request's delay.

The collection order is the thing to notice. The sequence polls its outstanding
tickets with `try_get_response` and drops each one as it is answered, so the
answers appear in the order they were *finished*. Had it blocked on `#1`, then
`#2`, then `#3`, the `got` lines would have come out in send order no matter
what the driver did, and the out-of-order work would have been real but
invisible.

Nothing here is random: the delays are chosen so that each request finishes
three ticks ahead of the one before it, which is more than the two ticks it
waits to be accepted, so the reversal is guaranteed rather than seed-dependent.

## What this chapter proves

- **Answers can come back out of order, and the ticket is what matches them.**
  The TinyALU cannot show this — it runs one operation at a time, so nothing
  ever returns out of sequence. That is why the mechanism is taught here first,
  on an empty DUT, before Chapter 38 applies it to the real one.
- **`item_done` releases the sequence before the answer exists.** That is what
  puts four requests in flight at once. Hold the handshake open until the answer
  is ready and only one is ever outstanding — and then the ticket has nothing to
  disambiguate.
- **`try_next_item` lets the driver take new work while old work is still in
  flight.** The driver accepts `#2` at 35 ns while `#1` still has seven ticks
  left on it.
- **Asking for an answer that will never exist hangs forever.** Nothing can
  distinguish "not ready yet" from "never coming", so it is the sequence
  writer's job to ask only for answers that are owed. There is no runnable
  figure for it, because the only way to show it is a test that never ends.
