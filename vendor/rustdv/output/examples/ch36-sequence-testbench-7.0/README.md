# Chapter 36: Sequence Testbench: 7.0 — figure map

Run with:

```
sim-common/run_sim.sh ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0 tinyalu \
    sim-common/hdl/timescale.v sim-common/hdl/tinyalu.sv
```

Figure numbers are the **book's** (D110: one numbering space per chapter, code
and transcripts drawn from the same sequence), and the `.rs` captions carry the
same numbers. Figure 1 is the book's SVG handshake drawing, which is why the
crate's first caption is Figure 2.

| Figure | Title | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The sequencer handshake | book SVG drawing — no code |
| 2 | The driver pulls items instead of being pushed them | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (`Driver`) |
| 3 | One body, three stimulus patterns | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (the `Sequence` impl) |
| 4 | The base sequence sends zeros | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (`BaseSeq`) |
| 5 | Random and maximum operands | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (`RandomSeq`, `MaxSeq`) |
| 6 | The env owns the sequencer and files its handle | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (`AluEnv`) |
| 7 | The test starts a sequence on the sequencer | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (`BaseTest`) |
| 8 | Two more tests, one testbench, no new components | `src/ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0.rs` (`RandomTest`, `MaxTest`) |
| 9 | Testbench 7.0 running | transcript — all three tests |

`AluCommand` and `AluResult` are re-shown near the top of the file without
captions; they are unchanged from earlier chapters.

Three tests, all ending `REGRESSION: PASS`.

## Transcript

**Figure 9.** Verbatim from `sim-common/run_sim.sh ch36_sequence_testbench_7_0
tinyalu sim-common/hdl/timescale.v sim-common/hdl/tinyalu.sv`,
`RUSTDV_RANDOM_SEED=1`.

Three tests, one testbench, one set of components. Only the sequence changes —
and the operands with it.

Worth noticing in the log: `BaseTest`'s components sit at `BaseTest.env.*`
while the other two sit at `RandomTest.inner.env.*` — the two later tests wrap
the env in an inner component so the sequence can be swapped by the factory.

## What this chapter proves

- **The structure holds still and the program changes.** Three tests, one set
  of components, no new ones. The only difference between them is which
  sequence gets started.
- **The sequencer is a component; the sequence is not.** The sequencer has a
  place in the tree and a path. A sequence has neither — it has a `body`.
- **Two calls, not one.** `start_item` returns once the sequencer has granted
  this item its turn and the driver is blocked waiting for its contents, so
  everything between `start_item` and `finish_item` happens with the driver
  committed. A single `send(cmd)` could not express that window.
