"""Check that no reader-facing document hardcodes a rustdv version number.

    python3 output/regression/verify-no-stale-versions.py [--list]

Ray's rule, and the reason this exists: **a version written into a file is a
staleness source.** It is correct on the day it is typed and wrong on the day
of the next release, and nothing about the release reminds anyone to go and
change it. The repository had exactly that — `getting-started-with-rustdv.md`
is the crates.io front page and told readers for weeks after the 0.1 launch
that crates.io held "the 0.0.1 name reservation" and that `cargo add rustdv`
would work "once rustdv 0.1 ships".

The mechanisms that do not go stale, and what each replaces:

    a version in prose        -> the crates.io badge, which renders live
    `rustdv = "0.1"` in TOML  -> `cargo add rustdv`, which writes it for you
    an MSRV sentence          -> `rust-toolchain.toml`, which rustup obeys

Scope is reader-facing documents only. **STATUS.md and the design log are
exempt on purpose**: they are dated historical records, and a record of what
ran on which version in July is supposed to still say July. Generated trees
(`rustdv/target/`, `book-pdf/book/`) are build output and are not edited by
hand. `output/environment-setup.md` is an internal sprint document, not
reader-facing.

This checks prose, not manifests. Real `Cargo.toml` files must pin versions —
that is what a manifest is for.
