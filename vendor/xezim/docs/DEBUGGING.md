# Debugging xezim runs

Practical levers for diagnosing a misbehaving simulation — no simulator
source required. Roughly ordered from "look at the design" to "look at the
simulator".

## Golden rules

1. **Use the release build.** `target/debug/xezim` is 10–30× slower and its
   unoptimized stack frames are several times larger. xezim runs the whole
   compile+simulate on a worker thread with a 1 GiB stack (virtual, committed
   only as used; `XEZIM_STACK_MB` overrides, `XEZIM_STACK_MB=0` disables the
   worker), so deep UVM elaborations work in either build — but older
   binaries without that guard overflow the default 8 MiB main stack in
   debug builds ("thread 'main' has overflowed its stack").
2. **Minimize first.** Almost every bug in this repo's history fell to a
   <30-line single-file repro. Cut the design in half repeatedly; keep the
   `$display` markers.
3. **Differential-test against a reference simulator.** When semantics are in
   doubt, the reference's output is the ground truth this project tracks —
   not the LRM prose alone and not another simulator's folklore.

## Front-end questions ("did it even parse like I think?")

- `xezim --parse file.sv` — parse only, report errors.
- `xezim --parse --dump-ast file.sv` — print the full AST. The fastest way
  to answer "does `p1::step` parse as a scoped ident or a member access?"
- `xezim --lint ...` / compile-only invocations surface elaboration
  diagnostics without running.

## Elaboration tracing (env vars)

- `XEZIM_TRACE_TYPE=<substr>[,<substr>...]` — trace every typedef-width
  registration, overwrite, and resolution whose key contains a pattern.
  Answers "who set this type's width, and to what, in which pass?"
- `XEZIM_TRACE_PARAM=<substr>` — same for parameter values (every insert
  site is tagged with its source line).
- `--elab-stats` style output and `[PHASE]` lines show where compile time
  and table sizes go.

## Runtime tracing

- `XEZIM_TRACE_ALWAYS=1` (or `=<substr>`) — per-fire trace of always
  blocks (kind, scope, written signals).
- `XEZIM_VALUE_TRACE=<substr>[,<substr>...]` — the "where does the data
  stop flowing" tool: prints every committed change of any signal whose
  hierarchical name contains a pattern, as
  `[value-trace] t=<time> <name> <old> -> <new> (<phase>; <writer at file:line>)`.
  Blocking writes name the writing process; NBA commits happen outside the
  scheduling process and are labeled `nba`. Bit/part-select writes mutate
  in place and print the arrowless `name = value` form. Each pattern's
  match count is announced at startup, so a typo is visible immediately.
  `XEZIM_VALUE_TRACE_LIMIT=N` caps output (default 20000). To follow a
  pipeline, watch each stage register:
  `XEZIM_VALUE_TRACE=wr_data,buf_q,out_q xezim --simulate ... 2>trace.log`.
- `$display` probes remain the highest-signal tool; `%p`, `%h`, `%b` on the
  suspect expression at the suspect time beats a wall of waveforms.
- Waveforms: `--fst out.fst` writes an FST for any viewer; XTrace
  (`--xtrace`) is the native dump. Coverage lands in `xezim_cov.json`.
- `$printtimescale`, `+UVM_CONFIG_DB_TRACE`, `+UVM_OBJECTION_TRACE` (UVM
  builds without `UVM_NO_DPI` — xezim provides the UVM DPI-C helpers
  natively, no shared library needed).

## Scheduler A/B switches

Same-edge process ordering is reference-verified (always blocks first, then
parked waiters in the active region, pre-NBA reads). Two escape hatches
flip back to legacy behavior — a quick bisect for "ordering race vs value
bug":

- `XEZIM_WAITERS_FIRST=1` — resume `@(posedge)` waiters before that edge's
  always blocks.
- `XEZIM_ACTIVE_REGION=0` — resumed waiters run after the NBA commit
  (post-NBA reads) instead of inline in the active region.

If a testbench passes only with one of these set, it has a same-edge race;
the default matches commercial behavior.

## Hangs and runaways

- **SIGUSR1 hang report**: `kill -USR1 <pid>` prints where the simulation
  is stuck (current time, active process origin) without killing the run.
- A memory watchdog aborts runaway allocation; `XEZIM_STUCK_CLOCK=abort`
  turns a dead-clock spin into exit code 3 for CI.
- Infinite loops in user code vs simulator bugs: add a `$display` in the
  suspect loop; if the index visibly wraps (e.g. a 4-bit counter printing
  `-8`), suspect signedness/width handling and minimize.

## DPI / foreign code

- `--dpi-lib <path.so>` loads user C code; `[DPI]`-prefixed stderr lines
  report load failures, unresolved symbols, and unsupported prototypes.
  Unresolved imports return 0 rather than aborting — grep stderr for
  `[DPI]` before trusting a run that "works" without its C library.
- UVM's own DPI imports (command line, regex, `uvm_hdl_*`) are built in;
  a user `.so` defining the same symbols overrides the builtins.

## Caching

- `--no-cache` forces a fresh compile — always use it while bisecting, so
  a stale bytecode artifact can't mask a front-end change.

## Reference-differential recipe

```sh
vlib w
vlog -sv -work w test.sv
vsim -c -work w top -do "run -all; quit -f" | sed 's/^# //' > ref.out
xezim --simulate -s top test.sv --no-cache > mine.out
diff ref.out mine.out
```

Keep test output on `T|`-prefixed lines so the diff ignores banners. If the
reference disagrees with your expectation, the expectation is what changes.
