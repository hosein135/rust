//! §9.2.2.2 — an `always_comb` whose only input is a MEMBER of a packed
//! struct must re-fire when the struct changes. Reference-validated.
//!
//! A packed struct is ONE signal (`st`), but a member read collects as
//! `st.m` — a name no signal matches. The dependency resolver simply dropped
//! it, so the block computed once at time 0 and FROZE. The values were stale
//! but fully known — no X anywhere to flag the miss — which is what made the
//! field report ("wrong but clean outputs after the input changed") so
//! confusing. The fix resolves a read name by stripping member segments from
//! the right until a real signal matches (`u.bus.m` → `u.bus`), i.e. the
//! §9.2.2.2 longest static prefix.
//!
//! The guard the first fix version got wrong: an UNPACKED array of structs
//! (`e_t arr [3]`) stores its element leaves as separate signals, and its
//! reads already collect per-leaf — resolution must not shortcut those to the
//! never-written base cell (that broke `comb_refires_on_struct_array_field_write`).
