//! §4.5 region ordering for `#0` continuations — reference-validated.
//! The inactive region (parked `#0` continuations) activates and drains
//! BEFORE the NBA region of the same time slot. A `#0` parked by an
//! edge-waiter-resumed process was previously promoted only after the
//! cascade's apply_nba, so `@(posedge clk); #0 x = r;` read POST-NBA r —
//! the "sampled one cycle early" checker/BFM divergence.
