//! Four gaps closed in one sweep, all previously recorded as known-broken.
//! Each is pinned against reference-simulator behaviour.
//!
//! 1. §10.4.2 — NBA to an ASSOCIATIVE-array element (`aa[key] <= v`) queued
//!    the value cut to `infer_lhs_width`, which knows nothing about an assoc
//!    element and answered 1: every such write committed the LOW BIT,
//!    sign-extended (11 arrived as -1). Blocking writes stored the value at
//!    its own width. The queue now skips the resize for assoc targets
//!    (`nba_target_is_assoc_elem`). The reference REJECTS this construct
//!    outright ("not currently supported"), so working support is a xezim
//!    extension; the old silent low-bit corruption was the worst of both.
//!
//! 2. §26.2.2 — `import pkg::MEMBER;` where MEMBER is an enum member died
//!    with "Symbol not found in package": the explicit-import resolver
//!    matched typedef NAMES but never looked inside an enum typedef. It now
//!    registers the one member (plus the typedef's ordered member list, which
//!    `.name()`/`.next()` resolve through).
//!
//! 3. A `parameter` re-declaring a name already taken by a module-local enum
//!    member was silently ACCEPTED — the parameter pre-seed fixpoint's
//!    duplicate exemption vouched for its own seeded value without noticing
//!    the name had a prior declaration site. Every other simulator rejects
//!    it; now xezim does too, naming both declarations.
//!
//! 4. Cross-module bare-name leak: with `shadower` declaring a local over a
//!    wildcard-imported enum member and a SIBLING `user` reading the member
//!    bare, user read shadower's local (truncated to the enum width). Root
//!    cause: the compile-time clock-generator detection EVALUATES each
//!    initial block's seed RHS, and that eval memoizes bare-name resolution
//!    on the AST node — under whatever `name_resolve_hint` the previous
//!    block left. The detection now installs the block's own scope first
//!    (and `run_process_stmts` resets the hint per activation as hygiene).
