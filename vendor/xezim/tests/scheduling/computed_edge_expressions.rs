//! §9.4.2 — `always @(posedge <expression>)` where the term is COMPUTED.
//! Reference-validated.
//!
//! Sensitivity was built from the identifier names appearing in the event
//! expression, so a computed term (`a & 1'b1`, `~b`, `c ? x : y`) contributed
//! no names at all: the block armed on nothing and never ran, with no
//! diagnostic. A plain signal and a bit-select both worked, which is what made
//! it look like a corner case.
//!
//! Sensitizing the leaf identifiers instead would be wrong, not merely
//! incomplete: `posedge (~b)` must fire when `~b` RISES — that is, when `b`
//! FALLS — so the edge has to be evaluated against the expression's own value.
//! Each computed term now gets a hidden 1-bit net driven by a continuous
//! assign, and the edge is placed on that net. Truncating it to one bit also
//! gives the LSB tracking §9.4.2 specifies for a multi-bit expression.
