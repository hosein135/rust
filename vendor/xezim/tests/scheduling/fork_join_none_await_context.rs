//! A `fork ... join_none` child parked on `process::await()` must be kept
//! SUSPENDED — not misjudged as finished — so its process context (`this` +
//! task locals) survives the awaited process terminating and the child
//! resumes with the shared handle intact.
//!
//! UVM's sequencer `uvm_sequencer_param_base::m_safe_select_item` forks a
//! `join_none` re-arbitration child that parks on `selected_sequence_request
//! .process_id.await()` then re-reads the request handle. xezim's
//! `is_pid_suspended` did not count an `await_waiters` park as suspended, so
//! such a child could be reported FINISHED and its context dropped, and a
//! follow-on read of the handle dereferenced null (`'selected_sequence_request
//! .request_id' read through a null handle`). The fix counts an await-parked
//! process as suspended (same class as the mailbox/event/semaphore parks).
//! Validated byte-for-byte against the reference simulator.
