//! IEEE 1800-2017 §4.4.2.3 / §4.5 — `#0` and the NBA region.
//!
//! A `#0` suspends the process and reschedules its continuation into the
//! Inactive region of the SAME time slot. Per the LRM §4.5 scheduling
//! algorithm the Inactive region activates BEFORE the NBA region, so an
//! NBA posted before the `#0` is NOT yet visible when the continuation
//! resumes — it commits afterwards, within the same time slot. This is
//! the reference-simulator behavior xezim follows; a differing commercial
//! camp (VCS / Riviera) applies the NBA region first and would show the
//! updated value at the `#0` resume.
