//! §4.5 — a comb block triggered by a blocking write must observe the writing
//! process's FINAL state, not an intermediate one.
//!
//! xezim settles inline after every blocking assign, and that is load-bearing:
//! nets and primitives have to propagate immediately (deferring them wholesale
//! regresses UDP edge evaluation and flop wake-up). But it also meant a
//! triggered `always @(*)` ran in the MIDDLE of another process's statement
//! sequence — so a later statement in that same process could overwrite what
//! the block had just computed, and the block was never recomputed because its
//! own inputs had not changed:
//!
//!     initial begin a = 0; b = 1; g = 0; end     // g = 0 lands LAST
//!     always @(*) if (a ^ b) g = 8'h55;          // ran after `b = 1`
//!
//! left `g` at 0; a reference simulator yields 0x55.
//!
//! Rather than reorder the schedule, the entries that ran mid-process are
//! recorded with the outputs they produced and re-run at the process's exit
//! ONLY if those outputs were clobbered — so nothing else moves, and blocks
//! with side effects are not re-executed in the common case.
//!
//! Not covered (and deliberately so): two INDEPENDENT processes racing to write
//! the same variable at time 0. Their relative order is implementation-defined,
//! and a reference simulator rejects the same shape outright when the writer is
//! `always_comb` ("variable driven in a combinational block, may not be driven
//! by any other process").
