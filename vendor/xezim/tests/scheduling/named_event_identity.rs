//! §15.5 named events — the four ways an event's IDENTITY could be lost.
//!
//! A module-scope `event e;` is backed by a 1-bit signal that `-> e` toggles
//! and `@e` arms on, and that worked. Every other spelling of "which event do
//! you mean" did not, and each failed SILENTLY — usually by waking a waiter
//! immediately at t=0, which reads like the wait succeeded:
//!
//! 1. An event ARRAY element (`ev[1]`) got neither an `events` entry nor a
//!    backing signal — only the scalar declarator path registered those. So
//!    `@ev[1]` armed on the array name, found no signal, and fell into the
//!    "not a real signal" delta-yield that exists for `uvm_wait_for_nba_region`
//!    — resuming instantly. `wait(ev[1].triggered)` never completed at all.
//! 2. A class-property event reached through a HANDLE (`h.ce`) had no identity
//!    outside the class: `->` parsed it to the placeholder name `"event"`, and
//!    `@(h.ce)` hit the same delta-yield. (`@ce` on `this` INSIDE a method
//!    already worked — that is the uvm_event path.)
//! 3. A `ref event` formal was bound BY VALUE, so `-> x` fired a name with no
//!    sync object; worse, the ref write-back on return rewrote the caller's
//!    toggle signal with the stale value captured at call time, cancelling the
//!    edge even once the trigger was routed correctly.
//! 4. §15.5.4 assignment `e1 = e2` recorded the alias, but only the TRIGGER
//!    side resolved it — a waiter armed on its own raw name and never saw
//!    `-> e2`. `e1 == e2` compared toggle bits and returned x.
//!
//! All expectations below are byte-identical to a reference simulator.
