//! §14.3 — the BARE `@cb` form of a clocking-block event.
//!
//! `@(cb)` (parenthesized) parses as a one-term `EventExpr`, whose sensitivity
//! builder resolves a clocking-block name to the block's clock edge. The bare
//! `@cb` parses as a `HierIdentifier` instead, and that arm had no such
//! resolution — it built a sensitivity on a signal literally named `cb`, found
//! no signal id, and fell into the "not a real signal" delta-yield. So `@cb`
//! returned at t=0 without waiting for a clock edge at all.
//!
//! That silently broke every `@cb;` sampling loop: the loop spun through its
//! iterations inside time 0, the clocking block's `#1step` inputs never
//! sampled a new edge, and outputs driven after it landed at the wrong time.
//! The parenthesized spelling in the same testbench worked, which made the
//! failure look like a sampling bug rather than a wait that never waited.
//!
//! Verified byte-identical to a reference simulator.
