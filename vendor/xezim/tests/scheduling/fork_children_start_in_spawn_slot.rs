//! §9.3.2: `fork` children begin executing in the time slot that spawned
//! them, ahead of whatever is still pending for that timestamp.
//!
//! Children used to be appended to the BACK of the current timestamp's
//! queue, so any event already pending there — a clock toggle, another
//! process resuming from the same `#delay` — ran first. A child whose first
//! act is an event control then armed AFTER the edge it was meant to catch
//! and slept until the next one. In a UVM bench that is a full clock period
//! of skew in every driver and monitor, since those bodies all run forked,
//! and it is invisible in the source.
//!
//! Both expectations are reference-verified.
