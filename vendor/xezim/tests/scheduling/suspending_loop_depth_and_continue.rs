//! Two defects in suspend-aware `for`/`while`, both reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. **Unbounded continuation chain → stack overflow.** A loop whose body
//!    suspends re-pushes its continuation from the LAST statement of its own
//!    frame, and `ProcCont::pushed` wrapped that already-exhausted frame in a
//!    fresh link every time. The chain grew one link per iteration, and the
//!    derived (recursive) `Drop` of that list aborted the process:
//!    `for (int i=0;i<2000;i++) @(posedge clk);` crashed with
//!    "has overflowed its stack". `repeat`/`forever` escaped only because they
//!    have a counted-waiter path. Fixed by splicing the tail directly when the
//!    resumed frame has nothing left, plus an iterative `Drop`.
//!
//! 2. **§12.7.2 `continue` skipped the for-step → infinite loop.** The
//!    suspend-aware path lowers `for` to `while (cond) { body; step; }`, so a
//!    `continue` skipped the step along with the rest of the body; the index
//!    never advanced and the simulation hung (no output, ran to max-time).
//!    A `LoopStep` barrier between body and step now consumes a pending
//!    `continue` while leaving `break`/`return` to exit the loop.
//!
//! Note both are invisible to a suite of short tests: nothing here loops more
//! than a few times, and `continue` in a *non*-suspending loop was always fine.
