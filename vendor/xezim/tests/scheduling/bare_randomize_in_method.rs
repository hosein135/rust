/// §18.11: a bare `randomize()` (no `this.`) inside a class METHOD is the
/// implicit per-object randomize built-in — it must dispatch to the solver and
/// honour the object's declared constraints, exactly like `this.randomize()`.
///
/// Regression: a bare call is NOT a *declared* class method (the source never
/// lists it), so the unqualified-method-in-class dispatch guarded on
/// `class_has_method` was false and let the call fall through and silently
/// return 0 WITHOUT solving. A class whose constructor/draw method called
/// bare `randomize()` left `rand` fields unconstrained at their default (0):
/// UVM's `obj_example_seq.count` (`rand int count; count inside {[5:10]};`,
/// randomized from inside a method) stayed 0, so `repeat(count)` ran an
/// unrandomized/inside range and the 35objections/03basic/06xbus transfer
/// bench drove an unbounded number of transactions (endless recorder/stream
/// growth) instead of the bounded 5..10 the reference simulator produces.
///
/// Both the bare and the `this.`-qualified call must yield 400 in-range draws
/// from 400 solves. Matched byte-for-byte against the reference simulator
/// (the reference simulator):
///   TAG_BARESOLVE bare=400 qualified=400
///   TAG_PASS bare=400 qualified=400
