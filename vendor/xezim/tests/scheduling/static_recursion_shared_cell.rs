/// §6.21/§13.3.1: a `static` subroutine local is ONE live storage cell shared
/// across all simultaneous activations — including re-entrant/recursive ones.
///
/// Regression: xezim previously kept a per-recursion-frame copy of the static,
/// restored at entry and written back on return, so a recursion window's
/// mutation was invisible to the caller frames and the static was effectively
/// re-initialised to its declaration value on every re-entry. That reset UVM's
/// `static bit first` in `main_phase` on every `phase.jump(reset)` re-entry
/// (40phasing/06started_ended), livelocking the phase scheduler.
///
/// This recursive method accumulates into a shared static; the outermost
/// activation must read 4 after four increments. Matched byte-for-byte against
/// the reference simulator:
///   TAG_INNER4 depth=4 counter=1 saved=1
///   TAG_OUTER4 depth=4 counter=4 saved=1
///   TAG_PASS counter=4
