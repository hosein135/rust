//! §4.4/§4.5 — the NBA region of a timestamp commits only after EVERY
//! active-region process at that timestamp has evaluated its RHS.
//!
//! `exec_statement`'s `#delay` arm called `apply_nba()` inline before
//! suspending. Inside an edge block that is premature: the other blocks on the
//! same edge have not sampled yet, so committing early lets them read the
//! POST-edge value. The trigger is ordinary testbench furniture — a single
//!
//!     always @(posedge clk) begin #1; ...checks... end
//!
//! observer (any monitor/scoreboard that samples a bit after the edge) broke
//! every OTHER clocked block that sampled a signal written by a sibling block
//! on that same edge. A one-cycle pipeline reference `d <= src;` recorded the
//! NEW value, so `d` showed no delay at all and every pipeline comparison
//! failed — while the DUT's own equivalent register was correct, which made it
//! look like the DUT was wrong.
//!
//! The flush is now skipped while `in_edge_block`; the scheduler's own NBA
//! point (`run_events_until`) commits at the right moment. A `#delay` outside
//! an edge block still flushes, since the active region there is just that
//! process.
