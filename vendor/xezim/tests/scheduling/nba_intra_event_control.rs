//! §9.4.5 — intra-assignment EVENT control on a NONBLOCKING assignment
//! (`lhs <= @(posedge clk) rhs;` and the `repeat (n) @(...)` form).
//!
//! The parser discards intra-assignment timing; a pre-parse text pass
//! canonicalizes it into marker calls the simulator implements. Only the
//! BLOCKING arm handled `$__xz_intra_ev`, so on an NBA the marker fell
//! through to plain expression eval — an unknown system call, i.e. ZERO —
//! and the NBA posted 0 immediately. Doubly wrong: the variable was
//! CLOBBERED with 0 in the same timestep, and the real value never arrived.
//!
//! §9.4.5 semantics: the RHS is captured at the assignment, the process is
//! NOT blocked, and the update lands when the event has fired n times.
//!
//! All expectations byte-identical to a reference simulator.
