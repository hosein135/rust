//! Zero-delay producer/consumer over a mailbox — found by the cross-tool
//! benchmark suite (`bench/crosstool/b4_oop_tb.sv`), reference-validated.
//!
//! Two independent defects, both of which made `fork ... join` return while a
//! child was still mid-loop:
//!
//! 1. §12.7.1: a variable declared in a `for` init has AUTOMATIC lifetime, but
//!    with no call frame (an initial block or a fork child) it was stored in
//!    the GLOBAL signal map. Two concurrent processes each running
//!    `for (int i = 0; ...)` therefore shared one counter and corrupted each
//!    other's index — the consumer's `i` jumped 2 -> 7 and its loop exited
//!    early.
//! 2. `is_pid_suspended` listed `mailbox_get_waiters` but not
//!    `mailbox_put_waiters`/`semaphore_get_waiters`, so a producer parked on a
//!    FULL bounded mailbox looked FINISHED: its process context (and with it
//!    its loop state) was discarded, and an enclosing `join` completed.
//!
//! Plus: a `get` parking on an empty box now admits a producer parked on
//! "full" first, which otherwise deadlocked both sides.
