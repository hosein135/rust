// Pure-SV regression for §6.21/§13.3.1: a `static` local in a method is ONE
// live storage cell shared across ALL simultaneous activations — including
// re-entrant/recursive calls. Previously, xezim kept a per-recursion-frame
// copy restored at entry and written back on return, so an inner recursion
// level's mutation of the shared cell was invisible to the caller frames and
// the static was effectively reset to its initializer on each re-entry
// ("fresh frame"). This caused UVM `phase.jump` re-entry (40phasing
// /06started_ended) to re-run `main_phase` with its `static bit first`
// re-initialised to 1, livelocking the phase scheduler.
//
// A recursive method that accumulates into a `static int` must see the whole
// sequence (depth 4,3,2,1 -> 4 increments -> shared counter == 4), matching the
// reference simulator byte-for-byte:
//   TAG_INNER4 depth=4 counter=1 saved=1
//   TAG_OUTER4 depth=4 counter=4 saved=1
//   TAG_PASS counter=4
