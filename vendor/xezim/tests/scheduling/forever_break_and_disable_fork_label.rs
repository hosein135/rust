//! Round-2 audit of the "two implementations" surface: constructs that have a
//! synchronous path (`exec_statement`) and a suspend-aware one
//! (`run_process_stmts`) must agree. Three defects, all reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. **`forever` ignored loop control (synchronous path).** Its loop checked
//!    no flag at all, so a `break` left the body no-opping for the rest of the
//!    100k cap and — the real damage — the flag SURVIVED the loop, silently
//!    skipping every statement after it, `$finish` included. Only reachable
//!    when the `forever` is nested inside a block; a top-level one is handled
//!    by the suspend-aware arm and always worked.
//!
//! 2. **`exec_forever_sched` dropped the continuation chain.** It took the
//!    current frame's remainder as a flat slice, so for a `forever` nested in
//!    a `begin...end` everything after the enclosing block was lost when the
//!    loop exited. Now splices via `ProcCont::pushed` like every other arm.
//!
//! 3. **§9.6.2 `disable <label>` could not name a fork child's block.**
//!    `disable_labels` was populated only for initial blocks at start-up, so
//!    `fork begin : blk ... end join_none` + `disable blk` found no target,
//!    fell through to the self-unwind path, and left the child running — a
//!    later `wait fork` then blocked forever. `fork : name` worked, which is
//!    what hid it.
