//! Three lvalue/select gaps found by one pipeline testbench, all in the
//! `q[i][j]` family:
//!
//! 1. §10.4.2 — a non-blocking assignment's TARGET indices are evaluated when
//!    the assignment is SCHEDULED. An lvalue the fast path couldn't reduce to
//!    a signal id was stored as an expression and re-evaluated in the NBA
//!    region — by which time a `for` loop's variable is gone, so
//!    `for (int j…) q[j] <= …;` landed on the wrong bit or nowhere.
//!    Fixed by freezing the evaluated indices into literals at schedule time
//!    (`freeze_lvalue_indices`).
//!
//! 2. §7.4.1 — a bit/lane select on an ELEMENT of a 1-D unpacked array
//!    (`logic [1:0] q [0:2]; q[i][j] = b`). Each element is its own signal,
//!    so this is a sub-select into that signal — but it matched neither the
//!    `arrays_2d` arm nor any other, and the write was silently DROPPED: a
//!    pipeline written as `vld_q[i+1][j] <= vld_q[i][j]` never advanced and
//!    its output stayed x forever.
//!
//! 3. §7.4.1 — `arr[i].field[j]` where `arr` is an unpacked array of structs
//!    and `field` is a multi-dim packed array. The field's element width was
//!    registered only for NON-array declarators (an array of structs reached
//!    `continue` first), and the read path only built candidates for Ident
//!    bases — so the select degraded to a 1-BIT read and a reference model
//!    compared one bit against a 64-bit lane.
//!
//! All three verified against a reference simulator; the originating
//! testbench (2-stage valid-gated pipeline, X/Z/mixed/LFSR phases) passes
//! byte-identically on both.
