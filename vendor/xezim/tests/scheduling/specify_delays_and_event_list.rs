//! Two fixes found chasing the "specify path delays are never applied" gap —
//! which turned out to be two separate bugs, neither quite that.
//!
//! 1. §30.4 — a specify path delay (`(a => y) = 4`) reaches the runtime as an
//!    `sdf_delays[dst]` entry, and the DirectCopy / fused-gate paths already
//!    refuse a delayed destination — but a cell whose output is computed
//!    (`assign y = a & b;`, i.e. every behavioral gate model) was bytecode-
//!    compiled, and the compiled writeback commits immediately. The compile
//!    branch now also requires a delay-free destination, so those fall to the
//!    AST path, which schedules through the delayed-update queue.
//!
//! 2. §9.4.2 — `always @(a) t = $time;` fired exactly once. A level-only
//!    event-controlled block is routed to the comb-settle path, whose
//!    sensitivity is re-derived from the body's READS; the faithfulness check
//!    only verified reads ⊆ list, which passes VACUOUSLY for a body that
//!    reads no signal — the list was dropped and the entry had no
//!    sensitivity at all. The check now requires the id sets to be equal;
//!    blocks whose list names signals the body doesn't read go to the edge
//!    path, which fires on the list exactly.
//!
//! Both verified byte-identical against a reference simulator.
