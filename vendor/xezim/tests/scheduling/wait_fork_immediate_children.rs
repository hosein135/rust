//! §9.6.1 — `wait fork` blocks on the calling process's IMMEDIATE children
//! only. Reference-validated.
//!
//! The implementation waited on the transitive descendant closure, and the
//! wake condition recomputed that closure against the live tree — doubly
//! wrong, because a completed child REPARENTS its grandchildren to the waiting
//! parent, so the wait chased the tree as it grew. A `join_none` grandchild
//! extended the wait past every child's completion; a persistent monitor
//! spawned by a child (the standard UVM driver shape) hung it forever. The
//! asymmetry is the LRM's own: `disable fork` kills all descendants, `wait
//! fork` waits on immediate children.
