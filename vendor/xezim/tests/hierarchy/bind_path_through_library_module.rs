//! §23.11 + §23.3.2 — a `bind` whose target PATH traverses an instance whose
//! module type comes from a `-v` library file.
//!
//! Binds were applied before `-v`/`-y` library modules were adopted, so the
//! path walker hit a half-populated definition map: the intermediate module
//! was "not a module", the bind was dropped with a warning, and the checker
//! never instantiated. The identical source passes when the library file is
//! handed over as an ordinary source, which is what made this look like a path
//! bug rather than an ordering one (xezim bind.path.inst.bug report; the
//! commercial reference accepts both invocations).
//!
//! Fixed by DEFERRING unresolvable binds to a retry after library adoption.
//! The first attempt is quiet so a library-provided target does not warn
//! spuriously; the retry reports anything still unresolvable — pinned below,
//! because a fix that merely silenced the diagnostic would also pass the
//! positive cases.
