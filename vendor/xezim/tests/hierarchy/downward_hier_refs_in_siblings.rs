//! §23.6 / §23.7 — downward hierarchical references (`child.grandchild.sig`)
//! inside a module that is instantiated more than once. Reference-validated.
//!
//! Child INSTANCE names were not in the inliner's local-name set (only a
//! typedef-disambiguation corner added them), so a reference rooted at one
//! kept its bare spelling in EVERY copy of the module — and all copies
//! resolved to a single instance's signal. The field shape: two sibling
//! hierarchies each wait on their own done-strobe via
//! `@(posedge clk iff (sub.core.busy === 0))`; both fired when the FIRST
//! sibling's strobe fell, and the slower sibling sampled its result while
//! still x. A single-instance MWE with identical stimulus cannot reproduce
//! it, because with one copy the bare path happens to resolve correctly.
