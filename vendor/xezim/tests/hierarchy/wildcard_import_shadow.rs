//! §26.3 — a local declaration shadows a name a WILDCARD import brought in,
//! and the shadowed name stays reachable package-qualified as `pkg::NAME`.
//!
//! Enum members of an imported package are registered under their BARE name in
//! one flat design-wide map, so both halves of that rule were broken when the
//! shadowed name was an enum member:
//!
//!   * The declaration walk removes the imported member when it reaches the
//!     local declaration, but `process_typedef` runs again for the same package
//!     after that walk (once per import site and per re-export hop) and each of
//!     those re-inserted the member — silently undoing the shadow. The local
//!     inherited the ENUM's width and value, so `int INIT_STATE = 500;` under
//!     `import p::*` became a 2-bit signal reading 0, and a class handle
//!     declared over a member name was unusable.
//!
//!   * `pkg::NAME` resolved through that same bare-name entry, so once the
//!     shadow was honoured the qualified form fell through to the LOCAL. It
//!     read the local's value truncated to the enum's width — which for the
//!     first member is 0, i.e. a wrong answer that still looks like a valid
//!     enum. `.name()` then stringified the local's bits.
//!
//! Both directions are pinned here: the local keeps its own type, and the
//! qualified reference keeps reaching the enum.
