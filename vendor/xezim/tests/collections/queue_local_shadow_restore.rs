//! IEEE 1800-2020 §6.21 — automatic (per-invocation) local storage, and
//! §7.4 — queue `delete()`, in the presence of bare-name collision across
//! call frames inside a CLASS method.
//!
//! A local `string p[$]` in a class method `check()` is keyed by its bare
//! name in the simulator's global queue tables. A nested call that declares
//! its OWN local of the same name (here `helper`'s `int p`) legitimately
//! shadows it for the duration of the nested call — but when the nested
//! call returns, the caller's `p` queue registration MUST be restored, or
//! the caller's subsequent `p.delete()` is a silent no-op.
//!
//! Without the fix, `p.size()` kept the stale pre-call count (the nested
//! helper's same-named local unregistered the caller's queue, so `delete()`
//! fell through every guard and did nothing) and `p[i]` reads returned
//! empty. After the fix, `delete()` clears and the two later pushes bring
//! the size back to 2.
//!
//! This was the real blocker for a UVM callbacks-inheritance test: its
//! `check_phase` declares `string p[$]` and rebuilds it across 6 blocks
//! with `p.delete()` between them; UVM-internal helpers reached during
//! `uvm_callbacks#(...)::display()` declared their own `p`, unregistering
//! the caller's queue. The test then saw `p.size()` grow unbounded with
//! every read empty, so every component reported failure regardless of the
//! actual callback queues.
//!
//! Verified byte-for-byte against reference simulators (OUT_SIZE == 2).
