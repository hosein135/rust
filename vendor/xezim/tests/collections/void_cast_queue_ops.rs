//! §6.24.1 / §7.10.2 — `void'(q.pop_front())` as a statement inside a
//! compiled always block. Reference-validated.
//!
//! The parser lowers `void'(expr)` to `Paren(expr)` (the cast is a pure
//! discard). The bytecode compiler's expression-statement arm treated any
//! parenthesised expression as side-effect-free and compiled it to a NO-OP,
//! so the pop never ran: the queue kept its length and every later `q[0]`
//! read the same head. The bare `q.pop_front();` form fell through to the
//! AST fallback and worked, as did the same void'() statement in an initial
//! block — which is exactly how the difference stayed hidden.
//!
//! Field symptom: a scoreboard comparing `dut_data == expected[0]` with
//! `void'(expected.pop_front())` matched transaction 1 forever and reported
//! every later transaction as a mismatch.
