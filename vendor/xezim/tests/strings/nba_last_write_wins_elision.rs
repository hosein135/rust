//! §10.4.2: when one variable is the target of several nonblocking assignments
//! in the same time step, the LAST one scheduled determines the final value.
//!
//! The NBA queue elides a write whose value already equals the signal's current
//! value — a large win, because flop outputs reload the same value most cycles.
//! That comparison was made against the signal table alone, ignoring any value
//! ALREADY QUEUED for the same signal in this time step. So a later assignment
//! that happened to match the *stale* pre-update value was dropped, and the
//! earlier one survived — exactly inverting last-write-wins.
//!
//! The shape that exposes it is the standard synchronous-reset idiom, where a
//! reset clause deliberately overwrites assignments made earlier in the same
//! always block:
//!
//! ```systemverilog
//! always @(posedge clk) begin
//!   d1 <= in;
//!   d2 <= d1 - 1'b1;
//!   if (rst) {d1, d2} <= '0;   // must win
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! With `d2` already 0 and `d1 - 1'b1` evaluating to 1, the reset's `d2 <= 0`
//! matched the current value, was elided, and the pipeline value survived the
//! reset. Reference-validated.
