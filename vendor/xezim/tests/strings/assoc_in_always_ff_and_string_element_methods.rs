//! Two bugs the sibling audit turned up, both confirmed against a reference
//! simulator before being fixed, and both silent — the code ran and produced
//! plausible-looking state.
//!
//! 1. An associative-array write from inside an `always_ff` was DROPPED
//!    entirely — `exists()` returned 0 afterwards, for blocking and
//!    non-blocking alike — while the identical write from an `initial` block
//!    worked. Cause: an `always_ff` body is bytecode-compiled, and none of the
//!    bytecode store paths can address an assoc element (the key is not a dense
//!    index and the elements have no signal ids). `lookup_array_name` misses,
//!    and the fall-through treated the base as a scalar and wrote a bit of a
//!    phantom signal. The compiler now bails on an assoc target so the
//!    statement runs on the AST path, which handles it. Scoreboards and
//!    coverage code write assoc arrays from clocked blocks constantly, so this
//!    lost data quietly.
//!
//! 2. String methods other than `len()` returned empty on an ELEMENT of a
//!    string collection (`q[0].substr(1,3)`, `q[0][2]`). `eval_builtin_method`
//!    resolves its receiver by NAME, and only `len`/`size` had a fallback for a
//!    non-identifier base — so an element reported the right LENGTH with no
//!    CONTENT, which reads like data corruption rather than a missing feature.
