//! §7.2 / §10.9.2 — unpacked structs declared in an INSTANTIATED module.
//! Three defects found by sweeping the same construct through every
//! assignment path and both scopes; all reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. **Two distinct unpacked structs in a child module SHARED storage.** The
//!    inlining path registered one packed vector per struct instead of the
//!    per-member signals the top-level path creates, so a member write landed
//!    in an ad-hoc runtime entry and a member read of an unwritten struct fell
//!    through the name-resolution suffix scan into *another* struct's member:
//!    writing `one.a` made `two.a` read back that value instead of `x`. This
//!    is the dangerous one — it corrupts silently and in the reader, not the
//!    writer.
//! 2. **A pattern assigned to an instance-scoped struct wrote array elements.**
//!    The "struct-field sub-path is an unregistered queue" heuristic keyed off
//!    `base.contains('.')`, which is equally true of an INSTANCE-qualified
//!    name (`u.one`), so it registered the struct as a dynamic array and wrote
//!    `u.one[0]`/`u.one[1]`, leaving every member `x`.
//! 3. **A nonblocking pattern assign never spread member-wise at all.** Only
//!    the blocking path called the aggregate spread, so `s <= '{a:1, b:2};`
//!    left the members `x` while the identical blocking assignment worked.
