//! Pure-SystemVerilog regression for two xezim fixes that surfaced in the UVM
//! phasing suites, distilled to the raw SV idiom
//! with NO Rust-side shims and NO UVM library. Each test is deterministic and
//! self-checking.

/// [A] An `event` member of a class reached through an associative-array
/// index, `@(arr[key].ev)`, must genuinely SUSPEND. Previously xezim computed
/// an empty sensitivity list for this shape and executed the body immediately;
/// inside uvm_objection's `while (need_to_check_all)` loop that made the loop
/// re-run forever -> stack overflow / UVM TIMEOUT.
///
/// Deterministic arming handshake (LRM 9.7.4 level wait) — no fork race:
/// the forked waiter sets `armed` immediately before the `@`; the parent
/// level-waits on `armed`, and if the `@` did not suspend, `e.resumed` is
/// already 1 at that instant.
