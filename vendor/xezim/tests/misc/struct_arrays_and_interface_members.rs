//! §7.2 — unpacked-struct storage outside the top module, continued. Found by
//! sweeping the same construct through every write form (member-wise / pattern
//! / whole copy) in both scopes; all reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. **An array of unpacked structs in an INSTANCE stored packed elements.**
//!    The top-level path registers every element member-wise; the inlining
//!    path did not, so `arr[i].m = v` wrote where no read ever looked and the
//!    member came back `x` — while the identical declaration at top level was
//!    correct. The child array also recorded no element type, so
//!    `arr[i] = '{...}` could not resolve the element struct either.
//! 2. **An unpacked struct member of an INTERFACE never took a pattern.**
//!    `bi.us = '{a:.., b:..}` has no signal of its own — only member leaves —
//!    so `resolve_hier_name` collapsed it to the leaf `us`, which owns no
//!    type, and the aggregate spread was skipped. The lvalue's fully-joined
//!    path is now tried as well.
//! 3. **An element-to-element struct copy in an instance copied nothing.**
//!    `arr[2] = arr[0]` resolved no type for `arr[2]`; an element carries no
//!    type of its own, but the container's recorded ELEMENT type is exactly
//!    it, so `p_elem_type` now falls back to the container.
