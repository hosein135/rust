//! §5.7.1 — an UNSIZED based literal (`'h1234…`) was parsed at a flat 32 bits,
//! silently discarding every digit above bit 31.
//!
//!     assign wide = 'h123456789ABCDEF0;   // kept only 9abcdef0
//!
//! An unsized number takes its size from the context (at least 32 bits), but it
//! must never DROP digits the source actually wrote. The natural width now
//! comes from the digit string — `max(32, bits implied by the digits)` — and the
//! usual context resize widens or truncates from there, so small literals are
//! unaffected.
//!
//! This one is nastier than a plain wrong value: a self-checking testbench can
//! still report PASS, because the literal it compares against is truncated
//! identically. A real testbench did exactly that — every check passed while the
//! bus carried the low 32 bits of a 64-bit constant.
