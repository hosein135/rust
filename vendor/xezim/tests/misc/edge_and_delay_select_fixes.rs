//! Three related fixes found chasing a full-SoC CoreMark hang, all in the
//! "select expression where a whole signal was assumed" family:
//!
//! 1. A DELAYED continuous assign with a range-select LHS
//!    (`assign #1 d[8:0] = a[8:0];`) was silently dropped — the delayed
//!    scheduler resolved bare-Ident LHS only, and an `if let` swallowed the
//!    write. An AXI bridge FSM whose next-state ran through exactly this
//!    idiom stayed z forever, its rvalid X-poisoned the bus arbiter's
//!    priority chain, and the first speculative read wedged the whole read
//!    return path.
//! 2. An edge clock that SELECTS into a signal (`posedge vec[1]`, or bit j
//!    of unpacked element i via an inlined `.clk(arr[i][j])` port
//!    connection) degraded to the base signal's LSB — or was dropped
//!    outright for an unpacked base. Now rewritten to a synthesized 1-bit
//!    alias net at elaboration.
//! 3. A cont-assign RESOLVING a constant net during the time-0 settle
//!    (`wire one = 1'b1;`, X→1) never woke `always @(one)` blocks: the edge
//!    baseline snapshot was taken AFTER the settle. Decode ROMs written as
//!    `always @(const_bit)` never initialized.
