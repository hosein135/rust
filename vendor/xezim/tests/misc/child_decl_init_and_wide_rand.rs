//! Two reported issues, both reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. **#81 — a declaration initializer in an INSTANTIATED module that reads
//!    another module-level variable folded to 0 / "".** Reported as a
//!    `string`/`$sformatf` bug; it is neither — `int n = 5; int m = n + 1;`
//!    in a child module produced `m == 1`, i.e. `n` read as 0. The inlining
//!    path const-evaluated initializers against the PARAMETER map only, where
//!    a sibling variable does not appear; the top-level path instead lowers a
//!    non-constant initializer to a procedural assignment. Child initializers
//!    now defer the same way, onto the static-init list so §6.8's "shall occur
//!    before any initial or always block is started" holds — the instance's
//!    own `initial` blocks travel via a list the scheduler drains FIRST, so
//!    an ordinary initial block would have run too late.
//!
//! 2. **#80 — `randomize()` returned a constant 0 for any rand field wider
//!    than 64 bits.** Two solve paths ended in `if width <= 64 { … }` with no
//!    else, leaving `Value::zero(width)` while `randomize()` still reported
//!    success. Values wider than 64 bits are now filled 64 bits at a time.
