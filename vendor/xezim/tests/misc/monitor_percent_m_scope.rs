//! §21.2.1.7: `%m` names the scope of the statement that CONTAINS it.
//!
//! `$monitor`/`$fmonitor` only ARM at their call site — the format string is
//! re-rendered at the end of every later time slot by `check_monitor`, after
//! the arming statement has returned. Nothing carried the arming scope across,
//! so `%m` resolved against whatever was executing at that point. For the
//! FIRST render — the slot-end print that follows arming — that is nothing at
//! all, and it degraded to the top module: a monitor armed inside an instance
//! reported the TOP while a `$display("%m")` on the line above reported the
//! instance.
//!
//! A BOUND instance is what makes this visible. With a plain instantiation the
//! lingering `current_scope` of the arming process happened to be right, so the
//! defect hid; the first print under `bind` did not.
