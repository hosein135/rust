//! §11.8.1: the DECLARED type decides signedness — an initializer's sign must
//! never leak into it. One root cause, four faces, all found via the Icarus
//! ivtest list (`sv_class_property_signed1..4`, `sv_class_method_signed1..2`)
//! and all confirmed against a reference simulator:
//!
//! 1. **Variable declarations**: `int unsigned x = -1;` / `bit [15:0] u = -1;`
//!    kept the literal's signedness, so `x > 0` was FALSE and `u + 10` was 9
//!    instead of 65545. (The parameter twin of this bug was fixed earlier —
//!    `param_signedness_and_generate_scope.rs`; these are the elaborate-time
//!    variable-declaration sites.)
//! 2. **Class properties**: same leak at class-elaboration time, and AGAIN at
//!    construction, where `property_inits` re-evaluation stored the raw
//!    literal value without re-stamping the declared width/signedness.
//! 3. **Class method returns**: a module-level `function bit [15:0] u;` had
//!    its return stamped with the declared type; the CLASS-method path only
//!    handled parameter-sized returns, so `c.u() > 0` read -1.
//! 4. **The conditional operator**: §11.4.11 makes BOTH branches determine
//!    the result type (either unsigned → result unsigned), but only the taken
//!    branch was evaluated, so `x ? s : x` with unsigned `x` gave -1 instead
//!    of 65535.
//!
//! The `?:` fix probes the untaken branch ONLY when it is a bare identifier
//! or literal: probing an arbitrary expression re-evaluates it, which doubles
//! hot-loop work and goes EXPONENTIAL on nested ternaries — two ivtest cases
//! (`br_gh661a`, `slongint_test`) went from pass to TIMEOUT before the probe
//! was narrowed. A function-call branch keeps its old typing rather than risk
//! a side effect; that trade-off is deliberate and documented here.
