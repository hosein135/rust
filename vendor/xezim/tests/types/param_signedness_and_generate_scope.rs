//! Two parameter defects found by auditing §6.20 / §11.8 / §27.6.
//!
//! 1. **Signedness lost against an unsized literal (const-eval only).**
//!    §11.8.2 step 2 converts every operand of a signed expression to the
//!    expression's width by SIGN extension. `Value::add/sub/mul` widened via
//!    `to_u64`, which zero-extends — so an 8-bit `parameter signed [7:0]`
//!    meeting a 32-bit literal arrived as its unsigned bit pattern and
//!    `SP * 2` evaluated to 506 instead of -6. `div`/`mod` already used
//!    `to_i64`, which is why only `+`/`-`/`*` were wrong, and only when the
//!    operand widths DIFFERED (two params of equal width were fine).
//!
//!    The same expression evaluated at RUNTIME was always correct, because the
//!    simulator pre-extends operands before calling these. That asymmetry is
//!    what made it hard to see: `localparam D = SP * 2;` was wrong while
//!    `d = SP * 2;` in an initial block was right.
//!
//! 2. **Hierarchical references into a generate block.** §27.6 makes a
//!    labelled generate block a scope, so `gblk.u.ID` and `g[0].u.ID` are
//!    legal. The undeclared-identifier validator runs BEFORE generate
//!    inlining creates the flattened `g[0].u.ID` keys, so it saw the bare root
//!    (`g`, `gblk`) and rejected it — failing elaboration of the whole
//!    enclosing block. Instance names were already pre-registered for exactly
//!    this reason, which is why a non-generate `u1.ID` worked.
//!
//! All expectations are byte-identical to a reference simulator.
