//! Two gaps found by auditing the batch 14-16 fixes. Both predate that work —
//! each was proven pre-existing before being fixed — and both are now
//! reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. §11.4.12 — `$` in a QUEUE index is the queue's last valid index. The READ
//!    paths push `dollar_bound` before evaluating the index; no LVALUE path
//!    did, so `ExprKind::Dollar` fell through to its `u64::MAX` default and
//!    `q[$] = v` wrote element 18446744073709551615: the write silently
//!    vanished, for blocking and non-blocking alike. The index is now
//!    normalised once, with the bound installed, over the WHOLE lvalue at the
//!    top of `assign_value` — plus in `resolve_nba_target` and
//!    `freeze_lvalue_indices`, which each evaluate it on their own path.
//!    Normalising the whole lvalue rather than one arm is what makes
//!    `q[$][3:0]` (top node is a RangeSelect) and `mem[q[$]]` (the `$` belongs
//!    to the inner collection) come out right; each index is resolved against
//!    its own base.
//!
//! 2. §10.7 — an associative-array element has no entry in the typed signal
//!    table, and the elaborator recorded only whether the array was
//!    string-keyed, never its ELEMENT WIDTH. So a write stored the RHS at its
//!    own size: `logic [3:0] aa[string]; aa["k"] = 8'hEF` kept all eight bits
//!    and `$bits` reported 8. `ElaboratedModule::assoc_elem_widths` now carries
//!    the declared width and the store fits to it — registered under the
//!    instance-scoped name for submodules. The lookup is deliberately
//!    conservative: a class member (`<handle>#m`) is never resolved through a
//!    bare leaf, because guessing a too-narrow width silently CORRUPTS data
//!    whereas guessing nothing merely restores the older store-as-is.
