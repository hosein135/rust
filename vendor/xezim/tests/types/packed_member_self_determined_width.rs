//! §11.6.1 self-determined width of a packed-struct MEMBER read.
//!
//! `expr_max_width` resolved an identifier only through the signal table, and
//! `req.addr` (a member of a packed-struct signal or port) is not a signal of
//! its own — the miss fell through to 0. Every SELF-DETERMINED use then took
//! the `.max(1)` floor, so inside a concatenation
//! `{(req.addr >> 5), lsbs}` the shift's left operand was resized to ONE BIT
//! and the whole term evaluated to 0; the concatenation returned just `lsbs`.
//! The same expression assigned directly (`x = req.addr >> 5`) was correct,
//! because there the assignment's own width drove the context — which is what
//! made this look like a concatenation bug rather than a width-inference one.
//! Values verified against the reference simulator.
