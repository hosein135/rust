//! §7.4.1 — READS of bit-selects and indexed part-selects on a NON-ZERO-BASED
//! packed vector (`logic [3:1] w`, `logic [1:1] h`). Reference-validated.
//!
//! Mirror of `nonzero_based_vector_writes`. Every `BitSelect*` / `RangeSelect`
//! instruction addresses PHYSICAL bits, but SV indices are DECLARED indices —
//! `logic [3:1] w` keeps declared bit 1 at physical offset 0. The write path
//! rebased through `emit_rebased_index`; three read paths did not:
//!
//!   * the bit-select read emission — `h[1]` on a `logic [1:1]` selected
//!     physical bit 1 of a ONE-bit signal and evaluated to x;
//!   * the indexed part-select — `w[1 +: 2]` read declared 3:2 instead of
//!     2:1, and `w[3 -: 2]` ran off the top of the signal and returned x;
//!   * `try_resolve_bit_ref`, the fused-gate fast path, which bypasses the
//!     bytecode compiler entirely, so `assign y = w[1]` read declared bit 2.
//!
//! Two things kept this hidden. `$display("%b", w[1])` goes through the AST
//! interpreter, which rebases correctly — so a procedural probe printed the
//! right value while the same expression in an `assign` did not. And the
//! fused path disagreed with the compiled one only on the LOW indices: `w[3]`
//! failed the fused range check, fell through to bytecode, and came out
//! right, so spot-checking the top bit passed.
//!
//! Field shape: a `logic [1:1] flag` register whose value feeds
//! `state[1] <= ~flag[1]` inside an `always_ff` — the read returned x, the
//! inversion produced 1 instead of 0, and the state machine took the wrong
//! branch.
