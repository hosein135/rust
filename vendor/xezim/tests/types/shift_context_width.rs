//! §11.4.10 — a shift's LEFT operand is context-determined.
//!
//! It is resized to the expression's width BEFORE the shift happens. xezim
//! already did this for `<<`, but `>>` and `>>>` shifted at the operand's own
//! narrow width and only then widened, so the bits vacated by a logical right
//! shift came from the narrow result rather than from the sign extension:
//!
//! ```systemverilog
//! logic signed [3:0] s = -4;     // 4'b1100
//! int i = s >> 1;                // 6  — wrong; must be 32'h7FFF_FFFE
//! ```
//!
//! Only `>>` exposes it. `>>>` preserves the sign either way and `<<` was
//! already handled, so every other spelling agreed — which is why a narrow
//! signed value silently lost its high bits only in this one form.
//!
//! Verified byte-identical to a reference simulator.
