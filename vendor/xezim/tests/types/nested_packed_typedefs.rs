//! §6.18 / §7.2.1 — packed struct typedefs whose MEMBERS are themselves
//! typedef'd structs. Both defects below are reference-validated.
//!
//! 1. **The typedef's width depended on HashMap iteration order.** A struct
//!    typedef's width is resolved from the width map built by the typedefs
//!    processed before it, and a member type that is not yet in that map falls
//!    back to 32 bits. Compilation-unit typedefs were processed by iterating a
//!    `HashMap`, so whenever the outer typedef hashed ahead of the inner one,
//!    `typedef struct packed { sp_t inner; logic [15:0] tail; } via_t;` came
//!    out 48 bits instead of 32 — and every signal declared with it was too
//!    wide. What made this pathological is that the order depends on the map's
//!    CONTENTS: adding an unrelated, uninstantiated, empty module to the file
//!    flipped it. The same typedefs declared inside a module were always fine,
//!    which is what disguised it as an instance-scope problem.
//!    Typedefs are now processed in dependency order.
//!
//! 2. **A two-level member read through an instance returned x.** Resolution
//!    split the dotted name at the LAST dot only, so `u.s.inner.hi` was tried
//!    as the signal `u.s.inner` plus the field `hi`, which names no layout. At
//!    top level `s.inner.hi` worked because each nested sub-struct also gets a
//!    layout of its own under `s.inner`; through an instance no such key
//!    exists. Every split point is now tried, longest base first — the layout
//!    of `u.s` already records nested members under their dotted path.
