//! Two defects found by running a synthetic gate-level benchmark against a
//! reference simulator. Neither involves any design IP — both reproduce in a
//! dozen lines.
//!
//! 1. READING a multi-dimensional unpacked array element in a CONTINUOUS
//!    assign (or an `always @(*)`) returned x. The bytecode compiler's Index
//!    arm only recognised `Ident[i]`; for `grid[i][j]` the base of the outer
//!    Index is itself an Index, so nothing matched and it fell through to the
//!    plain BIT-SELECT path — `grid[1][2]` compiled to "bit 2 of bit 1 of the
//!    array's base signal". Procedural reads went down a different path and
//!    were always correct, which is what made this hard to spot.
//!
//! 2. A bare identifier as an UNPACKED DIMENSION (`wire w [COLS];`) was parsed
//!    as an ASSOCIATIVE array and fell back to a 64-entry dynamic array.
//!    `[NAME]` is genuinely ambiguous in the grammar (§A.2.5) — associative
//!    when NAME is a type, sized when NAME is a parameter — and the parser has
//!    no type table, so it committed to associative. A 2-D `wire w [COLS][DEP]`
//!    then had the wrong shape: elements past the mis-sized bound did not
//!    exist, so instances bound to `w[i][j]` drove nothing and the net read z.
//!    Resolved during elaboration instead, where the parameter table exists.
//!    `[COLS-0]`, `[0:COLS-1]` and `[4]` always worked.
//!
//! All expectations reference-simulator verified.
