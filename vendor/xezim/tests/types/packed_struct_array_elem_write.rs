//! §7.4.2 — writing a packed ELEMENT of a struct member inside a PACKED array
//! of packed structs: `arr[i].field[k] = v`. Reference-validated.
//!
//! `arr[i]` is not a signal of its own here — a packed array of packed structs
//! is one backing vector — so the write must splice at
//! `slot*struct_w + field_off + k*member_elem_w`. The existing member path
//! handled `arr[i].field = v`, but this form's outermost AST node is an Index,
//! so it never reached that code and the write was silently DROPPED.
//!
//! The read path resolved the same expression correctly all along, which is
//! what made the value look like it was never driven rather than never stored:
//! reading back gave 0 with no error anywhere.
