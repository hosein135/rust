//! §7.4.1 — writes to part-selects and bit-selects of a NON-ZERO-BASED packed
//! vector (`logic [3:1] w`). Reference-validated.
//!
//! The bytecode compiler's WRITE emission used declared indices as raw
//! physical offsets — `w[2:1] = v` landed at offsets 2:1 (declared 3:2)
//! instead of 1:0, so the write sat one position high and declared bit 1
//! stayed x forever. The READ path had the rebase all along, which made the
//! corruption self-consistent and hard to spot: reading back the same select
//! returned what was written; only the WHOLE vector (or the neighbours)
//! showed the shift.
//!
//! Only COMPILED paths were affected (continuous assigns, and always blocks
//! that compile to bytecode). The AST interpreter normalized correctly —
//! which is why simple procedural probes passed while the same expression in
//! an `assign` failed. The field shape: a submodule's output port connected
//! to `parent_status[2:1]` where the parent declares `logic [3:1]` — the
//! port connection inlines to a continuous assign, and the status register
//! check read x after reset.
