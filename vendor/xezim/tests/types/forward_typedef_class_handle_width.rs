//! IEEE 1800-2017 §6.18 / §7.2 — a forward-declared class (`typedef class C;`)
//! contributes a HANDLE-sized slot to a struct typedef, just like any other
//! member. Before the fix, the forward-typedef's width-0 sentinel froze into
//! the struct: the class definition never overwrote the placeholder, so
//! `resolve_type_width` returned 0 for the handle member and `$bits` of the
//! struct dropped it entirely.
//!
//! Concretely, with
//!
//!     typedef class C;
//!     typedef struct { C a; int n; } with_handle_t;
//!     class C; int x; endclass
//!
//! `$bits(with_handle_t)` came out equal to `$bits(int)` — the handle
//! contributed nothing — because the forward declaration registered `C -> 0`
//! and nothing later replaced it. The handle is genuinely a 32-bit slot, so
//! the struct must be STRICTLY WIDER than the int alone.
//!
//! Companion reproducer for aionhw/xezim-core#15: this test FAILS on
//! `main` (forward-typedef width 0 propagates) and PASSES with the fix (0-width
//! type references fall back to the default handle width). Validated against a
//! reference simulator, which counts the handle (64-bit there) and therefore
//! also reports the struct as wider than the bare int.
