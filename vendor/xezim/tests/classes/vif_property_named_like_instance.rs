//! §25.8/§25.9 — a virtual-interface property whose name MATCHES the interface
//! instance it is bound to (`virtual foo_if vif;` bound to `foo_if vif()`).
//!
//! The §25.8 redirect rewrites the root of a chain rooted at a bound virtual
//! interface to the bound instance path, and both callers (`eval_expr_ctx`,
//! `assign_value`) RE-ENTER on the rewrite. When property and instance share a
//! name the rewrite reproduces its input, so the re-entry never terminated:
//! `vif.rload` inside a method aborted the process with a stack overflow
//! (1 GB stack made no difference — unbounded recursion, not depth).
//!
//! That naming is the universal UVM convention — `uvm_config_db#(virtual
//! iface)::set(null, "*", "vif", vif)` paired with `virtual iface vif;` in the
//! component — so every config_db virtual-interface testbench aborted at its
//! first access (xezim#123). Declining an identity rewrite is exactly
//! equivalent to performing it: the caller resolves the expression it already
//! had.
//!
//! Both spellings are pinned here because the crash reproduced on the WRITE
//! path first (`assign_value`) and on the read path independently.
