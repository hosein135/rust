//! §7.4.2 / §18.5.8 — MULTI-dimensional fixed-array class properties, and
//! `foreach` constraints over them. Reference-validated.
//!
//! Three coupled defects — the first is what made the other two invisible:
//!
//! 1. **`obj.m[i][j]` never resolved to element storage.** Construction seeds
//!    a per-instance cell for every element of the shape, but no read or write
//!    path resolved the index chain: the property fell through to a packed
//!    bit-select of its unused scalar cell, so `[0][0]` read a stray bit and
//!    everything else read x — while the 1-D `obj.m[i]` beside it worked.
//! 2. **A `foreach (m[i,j])` constraint was dropped silently.** The solver arm
//!    consulted only the 1-D shape table and bound only the first variable, so
//!    it found no range and returned false; `randomize()` still returned 1.
//! 3. **N-D arrays were in NEITHER element pipeline** — not in the fixed-array
//!    pool pass (built from the 1-D table) and skipped by the collection
//!    pipeline — so nothing seeded them and nothing coordinated a baseline
//!    with the element solver.
