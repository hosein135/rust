//! `instance_assoc_member` resolves a class-member collection against the
//! RUNTIME type of `this` (the heap's `class_name`) rather than the lexical
//! `class_context_stack`.
//!
//! A bare, unqualified method call (`body()` from an inherited `start()`) is
//! inlined without pushing a new class context, so the stack can still name
//! the CALLER's class. Resolving a member array through it then searches the
//! wrong class, finds nothing, and `foreach_materialize_keys_1d` returns
//! `None` — which the async `ForeachTail` path reads as "not ready" and
//! replays, so the loop repeats index 0 forever instead of erroring.
//!
//! The lookup is a pure existence check (the value returned is always
//! `<handle>#<member>`), and the runtime class is always a descendant of the
//! lexical one, so walking from the runtime class covers a strict SUPERSET of
//! the old chain — the change can only resolve more names, never fewer.
//!
//! CHARACTERIZATION, not a red-then-green regression: the divergence could not
//! be provoked here. Nine call shapes (bare call from an inherited method, a
//! base-typed handle, a cross-class caller, `fork`/`join`, a three-level
//! hierarchy, non-virtual dispatch, and assoc/queue members) plus all seven
//! AVIP UVM testbenches instrumented on the exact predicate produced zero
//! divergences. These cases pin the resolution behaviour so a future change to
//! the context stack cannot quietly regress subclass member lookup.
