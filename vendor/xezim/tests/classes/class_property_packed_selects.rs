//! §8.25 / §7.4.1 — packed class properties: parameter-dependent widths, and
//! bit/part selects on them. Reference-validated.
//!
//! Three defects, all silent:
//!
//! 1. A property whose packed range references a class PARAMETER was seeded
//!    from the class's elaborated signature — i.e. at the class's DEFAULT
//!    parameter value — so `bit [W-1:0] pw` in a `P#(16)` was created 8 bits
//!    wide. A later WHOLE assignment re-widened it, so the damage was confined
//!    to bit/part-select writes above the default width, which vanished, and
//!    to `$bits` until the first whole write.
//! 2. A single-bit WRITE to any packed property was dropped entirely: the
//!    element resolver handled only multi-dimensional properties, so a plain
//!    `bit [15:0]` had no handler. Reads fell through to a generic bit-select
//!    and were fine, and the part-select `v[15:8] = ...` beside it worked,
//!    which is what made this hard to see.
//! 3. An ASCENDING property (`bit [0:15]`) labels its bits from the MSB end,
//!    but a part-select WRITE spliced the bits a descending vector would have
//!    — while a single-bit write to the same property was correct.
