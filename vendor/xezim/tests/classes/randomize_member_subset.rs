//! §18.11 — `obj.randomize(<member subset>)`. Reference-validated.
//!
//! The arguments name MEMBERS of the object's class, not identifiers of the
//! calling scope. Elaboration validated them as ordinary expressions, so a
//! perfectly legal `d.randomize(a)` was rejected outright with "Undeclared
//! identifier 'a'" and the whole simulation aborted before producing output.
//!
//! Removing that rejection is only half of it: the listed members are the ONLY
//! ones solved, and every other rand member must keep its current value and
//! act as state. Randomizing everything would have satisfied the compile but
//! silently clobbered the caller's setup.
