//! §18.5 — a derived class declared in a MODULE body whose constraint refers
//! to an INHERITED property. Reference-validated.
//!
//! Constraint validation resolves `extends` through the top-level definition
//! map, but a class declared in a module body is a `ModuleItem`, not a
//! top-level definition — so the base was never found, its properties never
//! joined the allowed-identifier set, and the constraint was rejected with
//! "Undeclared identifier", aborting the whole simulation before any output.
//!
//! The identical code at `$unit` or package scope was accepted, and a derived
//! constraint touching only its OWN properties was accepted too, which made
//! this look like a constraint bug rather than a scoping one.
