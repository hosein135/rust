// §14.13: a process resuming on a clocking event (`@(cb)` / `##N`) runs in the
// Reactive region — AFTER this edge's NBA updates commit. So a counter bumped
// by `always @(posedge clk) c<=c+1` is already incremented when the `@(cb)`
// continuation observes it (verified against a reference simulator: c==1 after
// one `@(cb)`, c==4 after a further `##3`). A raw `@(posedge clk)` waiter keeps
// the "resume before same-edge blocks" behavior; only clocking events defer.
