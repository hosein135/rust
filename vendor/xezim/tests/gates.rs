//! Integration-test group: gates.
//!
//! Every `tests/*.rs` used to build its own ~66 MB binary that statically
//! links the whole simulator; 374 of them cost 24 GB and dominated
//! `cargo test` wall-clock (the tests themselves run in milliseconds).
//! The cases now live one directory down and are included here as
//! modules, so this group links ONCE. Tests, names and assertions are
//! unchanged — only the link unit is.
//!
//! The explicit module paths below are required: a crate root resolves a
//! plain `mod x;` beside itself, not into `tests/<group>/`. To add a test,
//! drop the file in this group's directory and add one entry here.
