//! Output sink for VCD / XTrace dumps.
//!
//! Two modes:
//!   * Inline   — writes straight to a `BufWriter<File>` on the caller thread.
//!   * Threaded — hands work to a dedicated writer thread. Two message
//!                kinds are carried:
//!                  - `Chunk(Vec<u8>)`: pre-formatted bytes (used for VCD
//!                    headers and anything written via
//!                    `std::io::Write`).
//!                  - `VcdBatch(Vec<VcdTimestep>)`: structured per-timestep
//!                    value changes. The worker thread formats them with
//!                    `write_vcd_value`. This moves the bit-by-bit ASCII
//!                    conversion off the main simulation thread, which is
//!                    the actual CPU bottleneck for VCD dumps.
//!                Batches are flushed when `pending.len() >=
//!                `VCD_BATCH_FLUSH` or at `commit()` / `Drop`.
//!
//! `VcdSink` implements `std::io::Write` so existing `writeln!(w, ...)` call
//! sites keep working unchanged.
//!
//! The underlying byte stream is a boxed `Write` ([`DumpWriter`]). For plain
//! dumps that is the file itself; for `.zst` dumps it is a streaming zstd
//! encoder (`auto_finish`, so the frame footer is written on drop — whether
//! that drop happens on the caller thread (inline) or the writer thread).
