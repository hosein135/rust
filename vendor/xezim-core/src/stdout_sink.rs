//! Buffered stdout sink for `$display`/`$write` output.
//!
//! Two modes:
//!   * Inline   — buffered `BufWriter<Stdout>` on the caller thread. Still a
//!                win over bare `print!`, which goes through a `LineWriter`
//!                and syscalls on every `\n` — picorv32 emits ~8k single-byte
//!                writes via `$write("%c",...)` and each was its own lock
//!                acquisition on the global stdout.
//!   * Threaded — hands filled buffers to a dedicated writer thread via an
//!                mpsc channel. Single-producer FIFO → output ordering is
//!                preserved.
