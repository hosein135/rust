# Commands

To execute a command, press space and type the command. There is fuzzy match support, so it is enough to type parts of the command name and it will display options that matches.

It is also possible to create a command file, extension `.sucl`, and run that. Running a command file can be done from within Surfer using the menu option in the File menu, through the toolbar button, or by typing the command ``run_command_file``. It can also be done using the ``--command-file`` argument when starting Surfer.

Not all commands are available unless a file is loaded. Also, some commands are not available in the WASM-build (browser/VS Code extension).

## Surver (streaming waveform server)

* ``surver_select_file <FILE_NAME>``

  Load a file from the connected Surver instance, discarding the current waveform view.

* ``surver_switch_file <FILE_NAME>``

  Load a file from the connected Surver instance, keeping the current waveform view.

## Waveform/transaction loading and reloading

* ``load_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load a file. Note that it works to load a waveform file from a command file.

    <div class="warning">In WASM-builds (web browser/VS Code plugin) it is not possible to open a file due to file access restrictions. Use <tt>load_url</tt>.</div>


* ``switch_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load file, but keep waveform view.

* ``load_url <URL>``

    Load a URL.

* ``reload``

    Reload the current file. Does not work in a web browser.

* ``remove_unavailable``

    Remove variables that are not longer present in the reloaded/switched file.

## State files

* ``load_state <FILE_NAME>``

## Command files

* ``run_command_file <FILE_NAME>`` (not on WASM)

## Frame buffer

* ``frame_buffer_set_array <SCOPE_NAME>`` / ``frame_buffer_set_variable <VARIABLE_NAME>``

  Set the data source for the frame buffer. Use ``frame_buffer_set_array`` to source pixel data
  from a memory array (a scope), or ``frame_buffer_set_variable`` to source it from a single
  variable.

* ``frame_buffer_set_mode <grayscale | rgb | ycbcr> <BITS> [BITS2 BITS3]``

  Set the color mode and bit widths used when decoding pixels.

  * ``grayscale <BITS>`` — each pixel is a single grey value of `BITS` bits (1–8).
  * ``rgb <R_BITS> <G_BITS> <B_BITS>`` — each pixel is packed as red/green/blue with the given bit widths (each 0–8).
  * ``ycbcr <Y_BITS> <CB_BITS> <CR_BITS>`` — each pixel is packed as Y/Cb/Cr (BT.601) with the given bit widths (each 0–8).

  Examples:

  ```
  frame_buffer_set_mode grayscale 8
  frame_buffer_set_mode rgb 5 6 5
  frame_buffer_set_mode ycbcr 8 8 8
  ```

* ``frame_buffer_set_width <WIDTH>``

  Set the number of pixels per row in the frame buffer display.

* ``frame_buffer_set_range <FIRST> <LAST> [FIRST2 LAST2 ...]``

  Set the displayed index range for each array level. Pairs of integers are matched to levels
  in order; extra pairs beyond the number of levels are ignored. Each value is clamped to the
  valid range of its level, and if `FIRST` > `LAST` the values are swapped automatically.

  Example — set level 0 to rows 0–479 and level 1 to columns 0–639:

  ```
  frame_buffer_set_range 0 479 0 639
  ```
